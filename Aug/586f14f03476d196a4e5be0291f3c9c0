 KANYAMAZANE – The protests in this area have started again today. Protests started with the strike last Sunday as a result of the Department of Human Settlements promising new roofs to 2 130 houses which were hit by the hailstorm in May.  The department released various statements last week saying it still intends on fixing all of the houses.
