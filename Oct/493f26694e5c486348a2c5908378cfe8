 Heyl met his accomplices André Stander and Lee McCall in 1977, while they were in prison together. Stander and McCall escaped from prison in August 1983, and broke Heyl out in October of that same year. The three then began a crime spree, which ended in late January 1984 when McCall was killed in a shoot-out with the police. Stander, who had travelled to America, likewise died in a shoot-out with law enforcement there in mid-February 1984. ALSO READ: Meet the last surviving member of the Stander Gang Heyl, who had travelled to the Greek island of Hydra shortly before McCall’s fatal encounter with police, then travelled to England, where he committed further robberies. These led to his arrest and, in 1985, he was tried at Winchester Crown Court and sentenced to nine years in a British prison.  At the end of his UK sentence he was extradited to South Africa and re-imprisoned on charges pertaining to the Stander Gang robberies On May 18, 2005 he was released from the Krugersdorp Prison having served a sentence of more than 27 years behind bars in South Africa and England. Having “wasted” more than half his life, Heyl, in his new book, shares what can only be described as one of the most memorable and inspiring tales you are likely to hear.
