 MEC Pat Ngomane, from the Department of Community Safety, Security and Liaison, says vehicles’ roadworthiness and drivers’ fitness will be a priority during this holiday season. Fatigue is another factor that has led to many people losing control of their vehicles, crashing as a result, and so losing their lives and killing others on the road.

“Such vehicles become compromised so much, that in case of emergencies the drivers may not be able to stop immediately,” he added. Another focus will be moving traffic violations; such as dangerous overtaking, excessive speeding, usage of cell phones while driving and disregarding traffic lights and stop signs, among others. With increased co-operation and tolerance levels among road users, collisions will be greatly reduced. “He urged those whose vehicles have defects or do not have valid documentation not to take chances. “They should stay where they are or use alternative transport. Road users should also play their part by using the road responsibly. Motorists should be patient with each other, because roads are shared spaces and traffic officers cannot be on every stretch of the road, ” said Ngomane. Roadblocks and patrols will also be conducted.
