 BUSHBUCKRIDGE – Three suspects were arrested in connection with the fatal shooting of a security officer and an ATM robbery on Wednesday afternoon. The Hi-Tech Security Lowveld officer was on his way to another call-out at around 03:00 that day when he came across 20 suspects armed with AK-47s, attempting to rob a Standard Bank ATM. “They opened fire while he was in his vehicle and riddled him with bullets,” response manager, Callum MacPherson, said.  Police arrived at the scene and another gunfight ensued before the suspects fled the scene. Hawks spokesman, Capt Dineo Sekgotodi said the arrests came about when members of the tactical response team, SAPS Hazyview and Hi-Tech received information about three of the men.  This led the investigation to Shatale, where two LDV vehicles, a white Ford Ranger which had been hijacked at Calcutta on Saturday last week, and a white Toyota single-cab bakkie which had allegedly been used during the incident, were seized.
