 Precautions must be taken to protect them when enjoying the festive season. As we all know they finish school before parents finish work and they start school again only after parents have gone back to work.  So the question remains: How do we as parents keep our children safe? Especially when they do activities like going out with friends, shopping, ice skating, going to see a movie or going with friends on a camping trip. December holidays are when the most reports of missing children, and even those who are abandoned by their parents, are received.  The duty of protecting your kid falls on each and every one of you. You are responsible to ensure they know the basic safety rules. Something simples as keeping the gates and doors locked when they are home alone and not to let any strangers inside could possibly be the one thing that saves their lives.  They need to memorise all emergency numbers or even just have it saved on their phone as a backup. The provincial Department of Social Development urges South African parents that before they visit any public spaces, such as shopping malls, their children should know their vital information, including full names, home address and the contact details of one of their parents. In addition, kids should be taught about:   If your child is missing or lost, please phone or visit the nearest police station or alternatively phone the nationwide emergency response.  Here are a few additional emergency numbers your child should memorise or have with them at all times. Childline: 080-005-5555 Lifeline: 086-132-2322 Emergency medical services: 10177.
