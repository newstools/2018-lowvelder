 WHITE RIVER –  Big prizes will be up for grabs, like a Toyota Aygo for a hole-in-one hit. Huis Betlehem is a safe house for kids who have been removed from their homes by social workers or the children’s court because of domestic violence or abuse. The house parents in White River currently have six children in their care. The Mbombela home is being reconstructed and is set to reopen soon. Huis Betlehem does not receive any subsidies from the government and relies fully on donations overseen by the Huis Betlehem Trust. Since the conception of the facility in 2000, it has been able to safeguard 360 kids.

That includes green fees and lunch at the halfway house. You can also sponsor a tee at R1 500 or put up a banner at the green for R500.
