 WHITE RIVER –  They were attacked on Primkop Farm on the R538 near Kruger Mpumalanga International Airport (KMIA). Four suspects broke the burglar bars in the bedroom with a hammer to enter the premises. Police spokesman, Sgt Cynthia Mbokodo said the couple was relaxing in their home at about 20:25, when they heard a bang. “Four suspects broke into the house. They shot the man in his leg and arm and the woman in the arm. Both survived the incident. The suspects then stole R4 000 and two cellphones.” Hi-Tech Security Lowveld operations manager, Callum MacPherson said the suspects fled on foot. The couple then pressed the panic button and Hi-Tech Security White River’s armed response and ER24 Medical Services responded to the scene. The couple was taken to Rob Ferreira Hospital. Hi-Tech Security White River’s armed response manager, Johan Killian said they had recently gone back to the farm but the couple had not returned. “We do not have a number for them, as their phones were taken.” AfriForum Lowveld’s district coordinator, Hennie Bekker said their organisation’s statistics showed that there had been 391 farm attacks since January, 50 of which had led to murders. “In November alone we have had 31 farm attacks, with one murder of a farm worker who was shot and killed in Limpopo.” Bekker concluded that there was a definite national increase of farm attacks this year compared to 2017.
