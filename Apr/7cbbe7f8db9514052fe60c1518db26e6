 MBOMBELA – In less than two weeks, the best aerobatic pilots and their machines will wow the crowds at the 2018 Kishugu Lowveld Air Show. The air show organisers are bringing the top-class performers to the Lowveld, and spectators (young and old) are in for an all-day and all-night treat. It will also offer a wide variety of delicious food vendors, exhibitions and the biggest kids’ play area to date, hosted by the Just 4 Fun team, well known for their huge kids entertainment area at the Uplands Festival each year. Parents will be delighted to know they can let their children play in a safe, secure and fun area on the day, at no additional cost. Get rewarded for solving these clues For as little as R150 per adult and R100 per school-going child, aviation enthusiasts will be able to enjoy great entertainment with no hidden costs. And what’s more, preschoolers will enjoy free entrance. Spectators can expect a full day of aviation tricks and delights, including a friendly rematch between a Jaguar F-Type and Gazelle helicopter and a live rock show after the spectacular fireworks display. Lowvelders can look forward to a rocking performance by the talented band, Gibraltar. This local rock band has been around since 1995, and they have promised to bring an electric performance to those aviation enthusiasts ready to party the night away. Lead singer, Jaime Negrao, said the band is extremely exciting about performing at Rock the Runway after-party. “There are very few bands in the world who can say they have performed on a runway, and we cannot wait to rock into the night at the Lowveld Air Show,” he said.
