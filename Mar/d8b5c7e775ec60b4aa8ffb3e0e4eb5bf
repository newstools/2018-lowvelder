 MBOMBELA – Friday afternoon saw the city’s madcap men strutting their purple stuff at the annual Hollard DareDevil Run, in aid of cancer awareness. The afternoon was warm and muggy as they pounded the pavements and streets, cheered on by loyal fans, family members and interested onlookers. These intrepid joggers tackled the five-kilometre run around Government Boulevard to raise awareness for prostate cancer. The notion originated with one bold and plucky fellow who dared to run through peak-hour traffic in a Speedo. The concept has since grown into a massive countrywide phenomenon which sees men of all ages, sizes and races coming together, clad in their purple Speedos, to run for this noble cause. Early detection saves lives, and it is vital that awareness is created through initiatives such as this. It is fun, daring and liberating, but it also uses the power of group activity and outrageousness to inspire action and positive change. These men – and the women standing behind them – are braving a topic many men are squeamish about, but one that needs to be discussed more often, that of the health of their private bits. As the sky started to darken the runners made their way towards the finishing line, amid great cheering and a warm welcome. Funds raised from the entry fee go towards cancer screening and awareness programmes countrywide. Also read: Essential information regarding the N4 and Easter
