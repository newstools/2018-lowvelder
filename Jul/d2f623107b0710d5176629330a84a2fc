Over a thousand people visited the first South African Wimpy restaurant on that day, excited to enjoy great food and a relaxed family atmosphere.  Few would have realised that they were setting a standard that would hold for the next 51 years. Today, Wimpy has more than 480 restaurants in South Africa alone, as well as footprint in Southern Africa and the United Kingdom. Over the years, countless families, friends and work partners have shared special Wimpy moments over a banana split which is a childhood favourite, right through to the ever-reliable Famous Wimpy Coffee and, of course, the popular Wimpy Breakfast.

Bigger cups mean even bigger moments to enjoy  #EnjoyEveryMoments #MakeTime to make more memories  #moments #coffee #love #MakeTime A post shared by  Wimpy South Africa (@wimpy_sa) on Jul 27, 2017 at 3:22am PDT  Wimpy’s deliciously affordable food and excellent service has always been a powerful draw card but the uniquely South African mix of friendliness and diversity is what keeps everyone coming back for more. While the Wimpy experience is always relaxed and fun, a lot goes on under the surface to keep it that way. Passionate franchisees and head office staff work consistently to make the most of the brand’s combination of excellent people and leading technology.
