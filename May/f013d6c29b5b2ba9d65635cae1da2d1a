 WHITE RIVER – They came, they shone and they partied. That was the Uplands matric dance which was held at the school on Thursday April 26. There were the modes of transport – bright and shiny – big, bigger – and small and smallest. The real stars of the evening, the matric class of 2018, were excited, radiant, stylish and pretty. Couples arrived on a red carpet and posed for photo with their friends, before the official dance. They were treated to a lovely dinner and party in an event which was fittingly glamorous.
