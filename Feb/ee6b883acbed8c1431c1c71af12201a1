 NGODWANA – The concessionaire of the N4, TRAC, warns of major delays due to an abnormal vehicle on the road tomorrow. The 7,5-metre-long vehicle, destined for Sappi Ngodwana, is expected to leave Wonderfontein between 07:00 and 07:30. The exact time of its arrival isn’t known, but TRAC spokesman Solange Soares Nicholson, warns that delays are expected to last throughout the whole of tomorrow (March 1).  She urges motorist to completely avoid the Elandsvalley (Waterval Boven) road, and rather use Schoemanskloof. “The driver of the vehicle, as well as the convoy, has been instructed to make regular stops to allow traffic to pass,” added Soares Nicholson, and advises road users to be patient.
