 BARBERTON – Norris, who is accused of murdering Luke von Johnston (66) and John Ntimane (73), appeared in the court on Friday. Tomorrow will mark exactly a year since Von Johnston and Ntimane were murdered. The two men were killed on Boondocks Farm near Low’s Creek. Norris, who was represented by Adv Coert Jordaan, appeared before Magistrate Lucky Mhlanga. Patrick Makhubela is the state prosecutor. Mark Norris (left) accompanied by family members after appearing in the Barberton Magistrate’s Court. The court was packed with family members of Norris, Van Johnston and Ntimane. When the incident happened last year, Norris, Von Johnston’s neighbour, handed himself over to police shortly after the shooting. He spent the night in police custody and arrived at court the following day in the back of an SAPS van. He was released without appearing in court or being charged.  Prosecutors at the time said there were no prima facie case and refused to place the matter on the court roll. The docket was returned to the police for further investigation. This was later returned to the Director of Public Prosecutions for a decision. He issued a summons for Norris to appear in court. Outside the court on Friday, Norris, surrounded by his family members, threatened this journalist. He said he did not want to be photographed.
