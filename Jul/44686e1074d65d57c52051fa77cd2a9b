MBOMBELA – According to Lowveld and Escaprment Fire Protection Association (Lefpa) chairman, Duncan Ballantyne, you could say he is a rough diamond with sterling qualities.
Lefpa is celebrating the 10th anniversary of having André Scheepers at the helm of the association. André’s natural habitat is outdoors, either in the bush or fishing, and that is where you will find him unwinding from the stress of his job. His family lived on a farm near Mbombela; with horses, dams and an outdoor lifestyle; which suited active André and his brother perfectly.
