When he got inside the house Louis and Thea were being robbed, then the suspects stabbed him above his nose. Fortunately the knife did not penetrate his nose bridge,” said Deysel. The suspects fired shots during the attack, but no one was injured. Several items including a PlayStation, cellphone and laptop were taken. They fled on foot through a fence that had been cut earlier into the neighbouring farm of Hannes Boshoff.
