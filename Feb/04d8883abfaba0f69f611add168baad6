 MBOMBELA – Gun owners’ uncertainty about the legalities of firearm renewals will persist for at least another month. This is according to a media statement the SA Hunters and Game Conservation Association (SAGA) issued after the Constitutional Court reserved judgement in a highly controversial gun legislation case on Wednesday. The Concourt hearing emanated from a Gauteng High Court judgement that was made on July 4 last year. The judgement declared sections 24 and 28 of the Firearm Control Act unconstitutional. READ: HOW TO APPLY FOR OR RENEW A FIREARM LICENCE Section 24 required gun owners to comply with certain time frames when renewing firearm licences. Once firearm owners failed to meet the requirements of section 24, no indication was made as to what should be done with their “illegal” firearms. Section 28 lacked in that it contained no such provision. The minister of police appealed Tolmay’s judgement. SAGA wanted the court to agree with the High Court’s findings. This would result in the amendment of the Act in a way that is constitutionally sound. READ: HIGH COURT RULING ON FIREARM CONTROL ACT According to SAGA CEO, Fred Camphor, sections 24 and 28 of the act prejudiced to law-abiding firearm owners. It was argued on behalf of SAGA that, as a result of these sections, a licensed firearm owner who failed to apply for a renewal on time would end up in the same position as he who had bought an illegal firearm. This, it was argued, was an unjustifiable reality. The Concourt reserved judgement in this matter. No date has been set for the court’s delivery of its verdict. According to SAGA, it may take between four and 12 weeks. Meanwhile, legal experts advise gun owners to keep renewing their licences as per the previously prescribed procedure. Because the Concourt has not confirmed the High Court’s finding of unconstitutionality, sections 24 and 28 remain applicable.
