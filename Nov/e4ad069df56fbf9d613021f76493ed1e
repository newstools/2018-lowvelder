 Round 6 of the Limpopo MX series (Womza-affiliated) was concluded at the Manna Motocross track located on the Manna Church property next to the R40. On October 27 more than 60 riders participated in the year-end and championship-deciding event, hosted by Manna MX. This series, now in its second year, comprised six events hosted by the Capricorn Raceway in Polokwane and Selati-Mx in Phalaborwa, caters for all riders irrespective of their age and or skill level.  So yes, there are some “old toppies”, but make no mistake, there is no lack of skills or competitiveness. Some of them are still as sharp as a Minora blade. Of cause most youngsters will not know what a Minora blade is, but then again, they know about Twitter, Instagram and such things which scares the living daylights out of some of the well-matured and skilled ooms.  The various classes were not that large so this allowed for some breathing space and safer starts. The odd “laying it down gently” did occur, and listening to some of the comments when riders finished their heats, there is no doubt in my mind that it will certainly stimulate energetic banter around the braai fires. It would also seem, if I listen to the gossip, that the 2019 season may see some interesting new developments which may well bring more energy and participation to this series.  But of course, you did not hear this from me. “We look forward to a positive 2019 with a lot more club-level racing, as well as the continuation of the Limpopo Series with a potential Swaziland challenge on the cards,” said organiser, Shane O’Brien.
