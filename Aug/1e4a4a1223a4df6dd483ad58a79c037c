 MBOMBELA – In a effort to spread the National Braai Day gees, Jan Braai is currently in the Lowveld on a 24-day braai roadshow. The team made their way to Dullstroom this morning, and will travel to their next destination, Barberton, tomorrow. On Saturday, Mbombela residents will have the opportunity to meet Jan.  The object of the tour is to engage with local communities and groups of people around braai fires, and to spread awareness of the National Braai Day initiative, calling on all South Africans to use September 24 to unite around a fire, share our heritage and wave our flag, all of which helps to build towards the long term aim of positioning National Braai Day as South Africa’s national day of celebration. As the Braai Team tours through the country they will experience local heritage, visit historically and culturally significant places, visit the best butcheries in these areas and naturally braai along the way. Jan hopes to engage with local communities, to hear their braai tips, secret recipes and to learn how and why braai plays such an important role in the lives of everyday South Africans. With a large part of the country being visited by the roadshow tour, some excellent braai stories are sure to be told, with South Africans encourage to share their love of braai with Jan and the team. In almost all cases the daily braais will be public and open for anyone to join, so if you’re in the area, look out for the braai crew and braai with Jan, his team and the locals hosting them. Jan and the crew are excited to unite around a fire and look forward to sharing South Africa’s favourite pastime with as many braaiers as possible.
