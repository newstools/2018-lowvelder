While applying for home finance and securing a bond has some unavoidable legal processes that can take time, securing finance should be stress free – and as simple and quick as possible. And perhaps most importantly, it should be personal. Independent home finance company SA Home Loans has a very different approach to home finance. They specialise in home loans, and this focused approach allows them to take an interest in every individual application for finance. As experienced home loan professionals, their consultants take time to understand each home buyers’ unique circumstances and motivate each application.  Regular feedback is also supplied and the progress of each application is communicated. Many unexpected costs accompany the home loan process, and SA Home Loans are at the forefront of innovative products to ease the financial burden of initial home ownership. For example, they have a loan facility called ‘Transfer Assist’ which may be used to cover the transfer costs of a bond. They also have a special home loan package for government employees, which forms part of the benefits of the GEHS scheme (Government Employees Housing Scheme), including both mortgage and non-mortgage options. What is noteworthy is that the exceptional service continues after the home loan process is complete.  Purchasing a home and securing a home loan is a long term financial commitment and choosing the correct financial partner for your investment is essential. There are also a number of benefits to switching a current bond to SA Home Loans. By switching, the equity in your current home could be used to reduce expensive short-term debt – and paying it off over the same period – but at a more favorable home loan rate. This has the impact of an improved monthly cash flow.SA Home Loans is South Africa’s largest independent home loan provider.
