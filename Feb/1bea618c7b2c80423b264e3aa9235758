 MBOMBELA – ‘Almost all’ pupils who were on waiting lists at the province’s public schools, have been placed. This was claimed by Mpumalanga’s spokesman for education, Jasper Zwane, on Friday. A week before he had undertook that by last Monday, each child of schoolgoing age would be placed in a public school.

The child in question started her first day of school on Monday, almost exactly four weeks after the schools opened on January 17. “As far as I know almost all learners who were on the waiting list have been admitted,” Zwane told the newspaper on Friday. Schools, particularly primary schools in Mbombela, have been struggling to accommodate all the learners on their waiting lists, but worked closely with the department.

As of going to press, only Hoërskool Bergvlam had received a mobile classroom. The department further made a “pledge to improve the manner in which admissions are managed for 2019”. Ward councillor, Tersia Marshall conceded that the department had found a solution, but added that the problem had not been addressed. “There are not enough classrooms for all the learners,” she said. “Until they build another two schools in Mbombela, the problem will not be solved.”
