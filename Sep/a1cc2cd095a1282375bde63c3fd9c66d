 WHITE RIVER – Up, up and away the fun flew at Uplands Pre-Preparatory’s superhero adventure day. Children from the school and outside had the opportunity to participate in the day that included a 14-obstacle race. The stations, all according to the superhero theme, made up the obstacle course. All the participants received a medal for participation at the end of the course.  Children could look forward to obstacles like the Tunnel of Terror, Catwoman Balance and Vaporising Villains.

“We decided last year that we wanted to do an adventure day for all the pre-preparatory children in the area as a community fun day,” said headmaster, Heather Prior. “There were a lot more outsiders than last year and we were very excited about that,” Prior said.  Children dressed up as their favourite superheroes for the event. “Superheroes are something that children can identify with, and we know that they just love to dress up as different characters,” Prior said, adding the teachers of the schools are superheroes to her. Some parents even completed the course alongside their children and pride shone in their eyes when their little ones received their medals.
“It is awesome and so much fun. All the obstacles were well arranged and the children loved it,” said parent, Megan Bisschoff. Community brings hope for SAVF Silverdays
