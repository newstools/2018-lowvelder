 MBOMBELA – The local CANSA held its Pink Walk on Friday evening. The event was held at Emnotweni Sun hotel under the theme: Women do it in pink. The participants walked through the beautiful scenery of Botanical Garden. Confidently dressed in shades of pink, they walked five kilometres. According to Pauline Moller, CANSA mobiliser in the Lowveld, it was a wonderful and incredible evening. She said the event was aimed at showing support for a fellow sister who is either a cancer survivor, caregiver or currently undergoing treatment.

We also encourage monthly breast self-examinations, annual medical check-ups and cancer screening for early detection, as symptoms don’t always present until cancer has spread.
“Women need to lead a healthy, balanced lifestyle, cutting out lifestyle factors that increase their cancer risk,” Moller explained. South Arkansas Medical Association, Kiaat Hospital, Curves and the South African National Blood Services (SANBS) were on site to provide free screenings. Thandeka Ndlovu-Moroka from SANBS said they conducted blood grouping test free of charge on the day. “This is our way of giving back to the community and cancer survivors. We further encourage people to donate blood because most of it goes to cancer patients,” she said.
