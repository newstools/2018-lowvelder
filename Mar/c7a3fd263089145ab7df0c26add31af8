 MBOMBELA – The much anticipated and popular Kishugu Lowveld Air Show returns to the sky with a bang under the theme Rock the Runway. Partners of Kishugu attended the launch to support Rock the Runway which will take place at Nelspruit Airfield on May 12. The launch reminded attendees why the air show is so exciting, with footage from last year’s event that gave everybody the chills and rock ‘n’ roll music blasting over the speakers.  Naranda Leeuwner, Kishugu’s marketing director, announced that this year there will be a rock ‘n’ roll themed after-party with a live band setting the mood and performing on the runway.   “We want to push the envelope and bring something new and fresh each year,” she said. People can expect everything from Elvis to Def Leppard, and this year’s fireworks show also promises to amaze the audience. Tickets cost R150 per adult and R100 for schoolchildren.
