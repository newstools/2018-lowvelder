 Now in its 23rd year, the awards measure dealers’ satisfaction with the various automotive brands. In 2018 a total of 33 independently researched brands formed part of the survey. A total of 1 005 responses were received and 840 of these were received from passenger and light commercial vehicles (LCV) dealerships. According to the NADA report, “Toyota has seen an improvement in its dealer scores in 2018 compared to 2017. In 2017 there seemed to be two groups of dealers: a large group of fairly satisfied dealers with scores in the 70 to 90 region and a smaller group of very satisfied dealers with scores above 95. In 2018 we still see that there are two groups of dealers, but now the two groups are of similar sizes, with the more satisfied group of dealers increasing in number.” ALSO READ: Dealership evolution necessary to keep up with new vehicle owners The industry overall average improved from 72,9% in 2017 to 74,5% in 2018.
