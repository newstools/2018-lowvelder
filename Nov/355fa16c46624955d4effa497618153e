 MBOMBELA –  Lowvelder was on the scene and saw workers from Sembcorp Silulumanzi cordoning off the area. Water was flowing down Piet Retief Street to the traffic lights adjoining Madiba Drive.
Owner of the centre, Kobus Jacobs was on the scene attempting to find out which of his tenants were affected by the pipe.  “This is a municipal problem. Our main concern is how long it will affect our tenants and which ones,” he said. Some restaurants, like Cicada, were left without water. SPAR confirmed it still had running water as it had affected the restaurants and shops in Faurie Street.
Sembcorp Silulumanzi spokesman, Richmond Jele said the pipe which had burst had been under extreme pressure, as it went from the treatment plant to the reservoir in Nel Street.  “They should be finished fixing the problem in about four to five hours at the most.”
Lowvelder went back to the scene on Monday morning to find out if this was indeed the case. Workers could be seen doing the last touch-ups to the road and it had already been opened halfway for traffic to pass through. Affected restaurant owners confirmed that around 18:00 on Saturday, the water came back on. “We can assure shoppers and restaurantgoers that there is no water problem here anymore,” a restaurateur said.
