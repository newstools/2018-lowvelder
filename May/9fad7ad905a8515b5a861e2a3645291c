The air show will also offer a wide variety of delicious food vendors, exhibitions and the biggest kids’ play area to date, hosted by the Just 4 Fun team, well known for its huge kids’ entertainment area at the Uplands Festival each year.  Parents can let their children play in a safe, secure and fun area on the day at no additional cost. Some of the free entertaining rides available will include a mechanical bull and surfboard, a diesel train on tracks, the thrilling parachute rocket, target-shooting gallery, a fly wall, water rollers and pedal karts.  For as little as R150 per adult and R100 per schoolchild, aviation enthusiasts can enjoy great entertainment with no hidden costs. And what’s more, preschoolers will enjoy free entrance.  Spectators can expect a full day of aviation tricks and delights, including a friendly rematch between a Jaguar F-Type and Gazelle helicopter, this time in a relay race with the Range Rover Sport Supercharge, and a live rock show after the spectacular fireworks display.  Come dressed in your best rock ‘n roll attire for the live rock show after all the action in the air. Lowvelders can look forward to a rocking performance by the talented local band, Gibraltar. They have promised to bring an electric performance to those ready to party the night away.  Lead singer Jaime Negrao said the band is extremely excited about performing at Rock the Runway after-party, “There are very few bands in the world who can say they have performed on a runway, and we cannot wait to rock into the night at the Lowveld air show.” Get ready to unplug your Saturday at this year’s air show on May 12.
