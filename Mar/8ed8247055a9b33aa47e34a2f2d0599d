Be that as it may, the department does not condone any form of misconduct, be it by learners or educators at the schools,” he said. Deputy principal, Jacques Kruger, confirmed the incident. “We confirm that we adhered strictly to the disciplinary code. “The incident has been reported to the department of education, and is being investigated along with them.” SAPS spokesman, Lt Col Erhard Stroh, confirmed the incident and said they would be investigating the matter.
