Thapelo Mashego, one of the students, said she learned a lot about the media industry from Masilela.   “I learned that I need to know about my audience before I go on air and start presenting my show. As a presenter you do not just go on air without researching what you are presenting and who you are presenting it to. I want to be a presenter when I have completed my studies,” she said. Makgotso Madalane, another student, said after attending the presentation about taking care of her skin she now knows just what to do. “It is important to drink water daily and make sure that I make time for my skin. When it comes to applying make-up I now understand what they mean when they say less is more,” she said.
