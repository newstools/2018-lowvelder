 Identity fraud seems like something that happens to other people, however, recently multiple local Nelspruiters have been targeted. A Facebook post from Melany van der Merwe, a Lowvelder, showed how her account was duplicated by an unknown someone, asking her contacts for money transfers. This malicious attack seemed very believable as the WhatsApp identity had her profile picture making her contacts believe it is her.  The fraudster sourced her profile picture and name then proceeded to Facebook to look for contacts of hers and their numbers. He would then give them a missed call on WhatsApp making them think it was the person in the profile picture. The fraudster then texted people saying his speaker is broken and he needs money urgently through a R900 e-wallet. Screenshots from Melany’s phone as the fraudster spoke to her contacts. Fortunately in Van der Merwe’s case only one of her contacts transferred the money and she could inform the people around her of the scam. If you receive any messages that seem suspicious or as if it was not who you thought it was behind the number, call and make sure. Also never transfer, e-wallet or deposit money into someone’s account without verifying they are who they say they are.
