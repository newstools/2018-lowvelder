 MBOMBELA – The rain did not damper the spirits of the pupils, teachers and parents of Kabouterland Pre-Primary School on Saturday morning. The school hosted its annual fun day at Nelspruit Primary – this year in the form of a colour run and obstacle course.  According to Kabouterland’s principal, Cezanne Laufs, the day was held as a fund-raiser for the teachers of the school. “We decided on a superhero theme because all our children and parents are like superheroes to us,” Laufs said. She added, “And of course God is our number-one Superhero.” Children and their parents dressed up and even decorated the prams of babies accordingly.

The crowds could feast on boerewors rolls, jaffels, and coffee and tea to ward off the cold.  “This is a great opportunity for team and spirit building and it is great to see the number of people who came out despite the cold,” Laufs said. Although the rain delayed the programme, the day was a success and tons of fun. ALSO READ: ‘n Wêreld van fantasie word hier waar
