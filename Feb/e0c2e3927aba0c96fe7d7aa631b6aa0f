Lowveld wine lovers will be ahead of the game with an early exposé to what’s ‘hot and happening’ in the world of wine just after the summer harvest. Tickets cost R180 for Thursday and R200 for Friday and are available via Computicket.com, Money Market counters at Shoprite Checkers, Tops the Grove and at the door (subject to availability).  Start the evening with scintillating sparklings from Graham Beck, Krone and Valdo Prosecco.  With around 200 wines for tasting from rock star producers such as Thelema, Spier, Boekenhoutskloof, Kleine Zalze, Fleur du Cap, Robertson Winery, Idiom and Vinotria, the Mpumalanga Wine Show is the place to connect with wine makers and discover more about the diversity of the Cape winelands and the intrigue of international wines.  Wine lovers should visit www.mpumalangawineshow.co.za closer to the time for a full list of exhibitors and wines on show.  The elegant stemware from Riedel make irresistible take-home accessories and gifts. For stocking up on deli delights, make a stop at the Just Biltong stand and Morgenster will have their full range of olive oils, olives and tapenades on display.  Light meals will also be on sale in the wine show hall.  And for those that dream of owning a wine farm, the next best is to turn your tastings into treasures; Tops the Grove will again run Shop@Show for easy wine purchases and delivery to your door.  The FNB Mpumalanga Wine Show has supported the White River chapter of Rotary International since the inaugural show in 2010. Proceeds are raised through auctioned donations from the exhibitors and directed to several community projects in the region.  The Mpumalanga Wine Show promotes responsible drinking and no under 18s, prams and babies are permitted access.
