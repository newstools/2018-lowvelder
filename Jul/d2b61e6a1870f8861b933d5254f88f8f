 KOMATIPOORT – The five men accused of murdering Deon de Bruyn and the attempt on Estelle Jansen’s life will remain in police custody after their court appearance on Friday morning. Derrick Makamo (24), Rawun Mhlanga (28), Sifiso Madonsela (33), Solomon Msimango (33) and Oscar Chauke (36) were arrested just days after the attack at Simonsvlei Farm in the Strydomblok on June 17.
De Bruyn (25), a farm manager, was fatally shot in his home after being overpowered by several men. His employer, Jansen (59), was shot several times and is currently doing well on her road to recovery. The accused’s legal representation abandoned the bail application, and the judge approved that the trial continue on September 7.

They had placards and discussed the case, determined to petition the magistrate not to allow the suspects bail. The family was disappointed by the fact that just a handful of community members attended to support them. The group crowded into the courtroom for the suspects’ fleeting appearance in front of the magistrate, and later told Lowvelder that they would continue to attend each appearance until the sentencing.
