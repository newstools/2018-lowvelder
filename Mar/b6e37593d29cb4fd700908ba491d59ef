 MBOMBELA – The day is being celebrated on Wednesday, and the South African National Blood Service (SANBS) is implementing a mass blood drive to ensure there is sufficient stock of safe blood available in South Africa. SANBS is launching the #NewBlood campaign on Human Rights Day, because it signals the start of the Easter holiday period. It is aiming to collect 4 500 units of blood on the public holiday.
It aims to maintain blood stock levels of five days. As of going to press this stood as 2,3 days. The SANBS is especially calling on first-time donors and lapsed donors who know that their blood type is group O, to donate. “Currently less than one per cent of South Africans donate blood, even though it demands little more than giving up 30 minutes of their time at least twice a year,” said Silungile Mlambo, chief marketing officer for the SANBS. “That means that we often experience shortages which place lives at risk; lives of babies born prematurely, of accident victims, of women giving birth and the lives of people fighting cancer. “The beauty of blood donation is that virtually anyone can do it. If you’re over 16 years old, weigh over 50 kilograms and practice a healthy lifestyle, you can be a blood donor. And by giving blood you can save up to three people’s lives. So something that costs you nothing is absolutely priceless for someone in need of blood. Nobody can make a greater impact than saving someone else’s life,” said Mlambo. She added that holidays are traditionally a time when they run short of blood because they are not able to host regular drives at schools and university campuses. She appealed to regular donors to spread the message and get new and lapsed donors to donate.  There are two donor centres in Mbombela: one in i’langa Mall and one in Riverside Mall. Visit them during office hours to make your contribution.
