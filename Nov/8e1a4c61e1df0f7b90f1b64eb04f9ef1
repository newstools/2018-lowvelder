 MBOMBELA – Police confirmed that ATM card theft is on the rise in Mbombela.  Hi-Tech Lowveld operations manager Callum Mac Pherson shared some tips on how the syndicates operate: 1. Criminals work in pairs to pull of this scam – They are always the friendliest person you have ever seen, so do not be fooled. 2. Many times suspects insert a coin into card slot so that users of ATM struggle and they can “offer their help”. There are various ruses but this one seems most common 3. The ruse is simple Suspect one will stand behind the victim in queue and when you struggle to insert your card they kindly offer their assistance. They then  help asking for your pin to assist in the transaction. Once they have this : 4. Suspect two also in the queue palms your card and gives suspect one  a similar bank card that he kindly gives back to you. Mac Pherson advises: Never accept help from anybody at an ATM unless you know them personally no matter how friendly, well-mannered or well-dressed they are. If anyone offers to assist you at an ATM kindly tell them it won’t be necessary and rather suffer the inconvenience of going to an alternative ATM. Check that you indeed have your card with your signature when leaving any ATM If you even suspect that your card has been tampered with rather block your card with your financial institution. The Danger of card cloning is also a very real threat and advanced technology is used to clone cards and gain your secret pin. Ensure you receive SMS notifications of transactions on your account and stop/block your card if any transaction happens without your knowledge. Never give your card to anyone to “swipe” due to card cloning most shopping outlets have machines where you insert or swipe card yourself. Remember that ATM’s mostly have Security officers or Security Cameras monitoring them – BUT if you allow another individual to “help” you it does not look like you are in danger.
