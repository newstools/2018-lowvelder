 MBOMBELA – The audience was once again captivated when Church Unlimted hosted economy guru, Dr Roelof Botha last Friday morning. His unique style of blending the serious matters of economics and politics with the lighter side of life gave new hope to the about 150 people who attended. His presentation was broadly motivational, in terms of highlighting research that confirms numerous positive structural changes in the country’s economy. At the heart of his talk was the economic revival of SA. Botha, the previous winner of the Economist of the Year award and former economic policy advisor to the National Treasury, has all the statistics to substantiate his argument that South Africa is on the brink of positive change. “The dramatic changes to the country’s executive leadership have resulted in a new-found spirit of optimism, as reflected in rising business confidence, a stronger currency and higher values for the country’s government bonds,” he said. “We just need to be patient. President Cyril Ramaphosa cannot fix a downward spiral of 10 years overnight,” he said. The spiral he referred to included the Sassa grant debacle, billions lost in SAA and PetroSA as well as irregular expenditure among others, that if avoided, could have created 210 000 jobs and could have built 650 000 RDP houses. “A recent study by Afro Barometer showed that areas that need government intervention include unemployment, health, education, roads and basic human needs like running water. Land isn’t even listed under the top 10,” he said and yet, it is one of the biggest threats to peace in South Africa. According to Botha the likely results of constitutional amendment for radical land reform include: • Protection of property rights in SA is diminished.
• Heightened policy uncertainty.
• Decline in the prices of land & related assets.
• Negative impact on balance sheets of banks and their ability to provide loans.
• Foreign assets will gain value, leading to currency weakness.
• Disinvestment in agriculture and food processing.
• Threat to food security.
• Substantial litigation costs arise.
• Negative impact on GDP and fiscal revenues.
• Unemployment rises.
• Potential for heightened socio-political unrest.
