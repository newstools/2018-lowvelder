 MBOMBELA – Thousands of workers are expected to take to the streets on Wednesday. The South African Federation of Trade Unions (Saftu) is objecting to the R20 an hour minimum wage agreement. It was set to be implemented on May 1 but has been postponed. The union called on workers to embark on a nationwide strike to pressure members of parliament to reject several labour bills. All employees, regardless of whether they are Saftu members or non-unionised, may join the strike.

Saftu spokesman, Patrick Craven, told Lowvelder that it was impossible to put a figure on the number of people who may participate in the strike. “We have appealed to all workers to participate. Industrial areas is be particularly affected as they have a high concentration of unionised workers.” The National Union of Metalworkers (Numsa), its largest affiliate, said they have about 350 members in the area and planned to bus them to Johannesburg to participate in the march. Craven urged the public not to heed the “warnings” going around on social media. “As the organisers we will do everything to ensure it is peaceful, organised and disciplined.” ALSO READ: Barberton prison hunger strike resolved
