Participants need to register on this link  https://www.a21.org/nelspruit-za Walks will take place in hundreds of cities across dozens of nations. This event is operated by a global anti-human trafficking organization, A21. The purpose of the walk is to raise awareness about the millions of men, women, and children who are still trapped in slavery today. By fundraising and rallying thousands of people around the cause, the belief is that this event will be the catalyst for the rescue and restoration of human beings who are being exploited. Walk For Freedom is distinctly recognized by its participants who will be wearing black shirts and walking in single-file lines all over the world—in local towns, through busy intersections in city centers, on dirt tracks in crowded villages, along bridges, tunnels, and water banks. Hundreds of local walks will be seen marching for a global end to modern-day slavery. “ We are convinced that if we do this together, if we keep showing up, if we continue to be tenacious, if we continue to turn up with strength, numbers, and courage, then we can see slavery eradicated in our lifetime,” says Christine Caine, A21’s Founder. A21 Overview: A21 is a global nonprofit organization determined to eradicate human trafficking through awareness, intervention, and aftercare. Currently operating in 13 countries, A21 aims to combat modern-day slavery through a multi-dimensional operational strategy: Reach, Rescue, and Restore. Through partnerships and the efforts of supporters all over the globe, A21 truly believes that a multitude of victims can be identified and assisted, and perpetrators can be brought to justice.
Millions of slaves. A $150 billion industry. One per cent are only ever rescued.
