 Two day visitors died in a vehicle accident in the Kruger National Park (KNP) on Thursday (October 4). According to a SANParks spokesman they were travelling between Olifants and Letaba camps. Initial reports suggest there was no other vehicle involved. The SAPS is investigating the incident and circumstances around it. Rangers and emergency personnel rushed to offer assistance but could not save the lives of the visitors.  According to eyewitnesses, the car veered off the road and overturned and the two occupants were flung from the car. They were certified dead at the scene. In reaction to the news, the managing executive of the KNP, Glenn Phillips, passed his condolences to the families of the deceased “It is always a tragic event to lose someone and we wish their families strength during this difficult period,” he said. “When reports of the accident were received, we immediately dispatched emergency medical personnel to assist and I thank my colleagues who responded.” Phillips also appealed to people to desist from speculating on the circumstances and to allow the SAPS to conduct investigations. The results will be submitted to the families at the appropriate time. He again urged visitors to the park to obey the rules of the road, stick to the speed limit and remain vigilant at all times. “We are approaching the festive season and encourage visitors to plan their trips between gates and camps so as to eliminate the need to speed,” concluded Phillips. The names of the deceased are not released as their next of kin have not been informed.
