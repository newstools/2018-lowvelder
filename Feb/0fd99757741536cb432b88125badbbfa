 MBOMBELA – A memorial service in celebration of Liesl Nel’s life will be held at the Lowveld National Botanical Garden (LNBG) at 10:00 tomorrow. “Liesl was always clear about her views on life and death. We would always jokingly chat about how we would celebrate life when we passed away, and she was clear that she was not scared of death,” said the family’s spokesman, Carmen Botes. According to Botes, the LNBG was Nel’s favourite place in the city.

People will also bring along handwritten devotions to Liesl, which we will pin up on a board.
