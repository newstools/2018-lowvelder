 MBOMBELA – According to Bossies Community Justice’s (BCJ) Albert Gryvenstein, the victim’s wife came home to find her husband bleeding on their bed at around 19:00. “He was allegedly sitting inside near a window in the kitchen when he was attacked. So far we can determine that only his wallet is missing.” Molenaar’s cellphone was found on the scene on a table next to the chair he had been sitting on. An axe was also discovered, but had no traces of blood on it. Blood was found in the kitchen, on the toilet and on a broken window. Chair Desmond Molenaar was sitting on when he was attacked. Hi-Tech Security Lowveld operations manager Callum MacPherson said they responded when the wife pressed the panic button. “The children of the couple were in their rooms when the attack took place,” said MacPherson. He said they could not determine how many attackers were involved as there was no evidence to determine this, and no witnesses except Molenaar, who could not talk. Hi-Tech Medical Services paramedic Strini Ranea said he treated Molenaar on the scene and said he was still conscious. “His whole side of his face has been damaged. You can clearly see the dented mark of the pole that struck his face. He must have been struck with a force. He lost a lot of blood and was breathing on his own.” Police spokesman Lt Col Erhard Stroh said they are investigating the cause of the attack. “We cannot rule it as a house robbery until we have investigated the matter further.” Molenaar was taken to Mediclinic Nelspruit and transferred to Milpark Hospital for plastic surgery. At the time of going to press, Lowvelder could not reach Molenaar’s family for comment.
