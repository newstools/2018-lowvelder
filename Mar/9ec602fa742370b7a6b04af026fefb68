 MBOMBELA – The Rajasthani Folk Dance group, hailing from Rajasthan in India, was the flavour of the night this past Saturday, as members enchanted and delighted the audience at the civic centre. First up, however, were the youngest members of the evening’s entertainment, beautifully dressed little girls in flowers woven into their hair and stunning beaded gowns to go with the occasion. They moved like princesses and certainly looked the part. Also read: Court gives judgment in Bundu Lodge court drama  After this was the turn of the Zulu dance group. Members evoked the power and force of Africa in every foot-stomping thump, and their soaring voices and powerful movements brought the culture and passion of a proud nation alive. A beautiful dance was performed, bringing to life the legend of a demon who vowed that no man would ever stop him. He reckoned without women though, and a goddess ultimately was the one sent to defeat him. The demonstrative facial expressions and the sinewy, evocative dance perfectly depicted the battle, at times sensual and gentle, alternating with almost violent, thrusting movements.

Performing ghoomer, godi, kacchi, kalbeliya and chari dances accompanied by traditional Rajasthani songs, the music and dance forms are very similar to how they have been for the past 1 000 years. The musicians’ haunting flute music, deep drumbeat and soaring voices only added to the vibrant and buzzing atmosphere in the auditorium as the dancers swirled and twirled like whirling dervishes in the desert night, bright colours and glittering gold enveloping them in a flurry of dazzling light. This was certainly a night to remember. Also read: Lowvelder is Caxton’s best
