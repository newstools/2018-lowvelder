 MBOMBELA – The so-called corpse flower took 10 years to bloom. Once it does, the flower lasts for about two days before becoming dormant again.  Flower enthusiasts and laymen alike looked forward to this past weekend with much anticipation, as the expected date of the flowering extended to Saturday. Indeed it bloomed on Saturday and admirers, young and old alike, could get a whiff of the plant’s famous scent.  Its smell has been described as rotting meat once the flower opens to attract pollinating insects.
The event, the first for this kind of corpse flower in the Lowveld, attracted about 1 500 visitors by Sunday.
Lourens Grobler, owner of Afri Orchids, said he was touched to see so many people visit the flower. “The response was so overwhelming. I was so surprised, I never knew that there so many people in this area who love flowers so much. For us, it was about creating awareness about this unique flower,” said Grobler.  Those who saw it may consider themselves lucky. It is extremely difficult to grow as it needs a special place and environment with consistent nutrition. Visitors were also asked to make a R10 contribution for attending. All of these proceeds will be donated to the Nelspruit SPCA. In total, R9 400 was raised, Grobler said.
