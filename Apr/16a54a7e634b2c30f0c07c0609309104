 WHITE RIVER – Suspects fled emptyhanded from an attempted CIT heist on the R538 between Sabie and White River today. At about 13:00 the G4S security vehicle was approached from the back by a white Toyota Hilux single cab bakkie and white Golf. According to Shaun Terblanche of J&M Security the suspects forced the vehicle to a standstill by shooting out its tyres. The suspects took the crew’s firearm but did not bomb the truck. They left the scene with the crew firearm but no money. Apparently four men were involved and were seen fleeing on the back of the bakkie in the direction of Sabie.  Nobody was injured, but the road will stay closed for a few hours. The incident was confirmed by Capt Pieter Smit of the flying squad. A search for the suspects has commenced.
