 MBOMBELA –  The newly formed Nocoré Ensemble, together with pianist Janette Rottcher, delighted the audience. They performed favourites such as Mozart’s “Laudate dominum”, the traditional “Deck the halls”, and some new works such as Kim Arnesen’s “Even when He is silent”.  The Nocoré Ensemble is made up of 12 voices, sourced from Pretoria, Johannesburg, Potchefstroom and Mbombela, and only met on Saturday afternoon for one rehearsal before the concert.  However, those who did not know, would never have guessed. The performance was effortless and all the harmonies solid in their complexity.  One of the audience members, Felicia Lemmer, commented that only musicians would probably know what feat the Nocoré Ensemble achieved by singing such complex and gorgeous music, and without a conductor to boot.  Rottcher also really impressed on the piano, and her rendition of Chopin’s “Andante spianato et grande polonaise brillante” drew a standing ovation from the audience.
