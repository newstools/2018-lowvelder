 MBOMBELA – The ongoing construction on Friedenheim Road has once again come to a halt, much to the chagrin of motorists. According to a source close to the project, who requested to remain anonymous for professional reasons, contractors have again not been paid, this time for the past two months.

Initially the project was to be completed in November 2017, but work halted in late September 2017 due to non-payment of contractors. The contractors resumed their activities on October 16 after a payment had been made. Since then, work on the third and final phase between Kragbron and Suikerriet streets has again been halted.
