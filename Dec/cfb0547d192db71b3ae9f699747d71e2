 Many things can happen to increase the risk of a relapse. Review the list below and check the items that might cause problems/more stress for you and your recovery programme during the holidays. Then total up the number of check marks and assess your relapse risk. • More alcohol and drugs at parties
• Shortage of money because of travel or gift buying
• More stress caused by hectic pace (like traffic, crowds, busy shopping centres)
• Normal routine interrupted
• Stopping exercise
• Not going to support meetings
• Not going to therapy
• Party atmosphere/Christmas spirit
• More contact with family
• Increased emotions from holiday memories
• Increased anxiety regarding triggers and cravings
• Frustration of not having time to meet responsibilities
• Coping with “New Year’s Eve” type occasions
• Extra free time with no structure.  Mild: If you checked one to three items, the holidays produce only a slightly increased risk of relapse.
Moderate: If you checked four to six items, the holidays add a lot of stress to your life. Relapse risk is related to how well you cope with increased stress. Your score indicates that you need to plan carefully for your recovery during the holidays. ALSO READ:Are you a social media addict? Know the symptoms and the cure! Severe: If you checked seven or more items, the holidays add a major amount of stress to your life. Relapse prevention means learning how to recognise added stress and taking extra care during dangerous periods. Your score indicates the holidays are one of these periods for you. REMEMBER: No one has to relapse! No one benefits from a relapse. Think about your recovery plan. Add some meetings. Schedule your time. See your counsellor. To get through this stressful time, use the tools that have helped you stay abstinent in recovery. Source: With gratitude to the MATRIX programme  Dr Breggie Smook (therapist at Sanca Lowveld) included the following practical tips for the festive season: • It is very important to have an escape/survival plan before the festive season starts! If you do not think and plan now while your mind is clear, you will have a much harder time when you are overwhelmed with triggers and substances.
• Put time and distance between you and your substance. Foe example when you crave – give it 30 minutes before you go and buy the liquor/call the dealer.
• Don’t entertain your craving thoughts – distract your thoughts and keep busy. Get off the couch and wash the dishes or walk the dog.
• Avoid your triggers
• If you have to attend a function, sit with people who know your struggle and status. Use your friends as a support to protect you.
• Don’t go on an empty stomach to a function.
• Don’t stay too long at the function.
• Go with your own transport to enable you to leave when you need to.
• If you don’t trust yourself, go with someone you can trust and will act in your best interest. Sanca Lowveld offices are open during the festive season (except December 25, 26 and January 1). It will provide services to everyone who needs support and encouragement – even if not participating in a current programme.
