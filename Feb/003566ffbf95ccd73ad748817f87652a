 MBOMBELA – Jesslyn has been diagnosed with Angelman syndrome, a genetic disorder that affects the nervous system. International Angelman Day is commemorated each year on February 15. Jesslyn Mulder. Those diagnosed with the disorder often have a range of symptoms that most commonly include developmental and intellectual delays, speech impairments and difficulties with gross and fine motor movement as well as recurrent seizures. Yulandi Jansma, marketing manager at the school, explained that Angelman syndrome has also been referred to as the “laughing puppet syndrome” due to the unique behaviour exhibiting by those diagnosed with the disorder.  “Besides having a difficulty controlling the movement of their limbs (which often presents itself as wild flapping motions), those with Angelmen syndrome are also generally smiling, happy, excitable, energetic, and hyperactive. They also often present with sleep difficulties and short attention spans.”  The school thus decided to create awareness of the syndrome by all wearing blue on the day. Jesslyn’s family said the focus of the day for 2018 was on all the research done around the world to improve the lives of these “angels”. “Healing of Angelman syndrome will mean that Jesslyn could communicate if she was hungry, thirsty, or tired. She will be able to tell us if she is hurt or upset. She will be able to speak to other children and she would be able to call us Mommy and Daddy.”  It would also give her better control of her hands, arms, legs and feet. “Then she will be able to write, dress herself, run around, climb trees, sleep through the night and do many more things other children do daily. Our hope is high and Jesslyn’s happiness and strength even bigger.”
