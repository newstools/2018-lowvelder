 MBOMBELA – It’s time to get your head in the game for the annual CANSA Shavathon, which will be hosted across the city this weekend. “This show of solidarity helps ease the strain experienced by patients who lose their hair due to treatment,” said Sr Rona Labuschagne, of CANSA Lowveld.

On both these evenings patrons to the Jock Pub and Grill will also have the opportunity to make their contribution to this worthy cause. A donation of R50 for adults and R25 for children under 12 is all you need to be part of this initiative, which allows people from all walks of life to “get loud in colour and give hope by participating,” according to the organisation. In addition to this weekend’s programme, CANSA Lowveld has also challenged local businesses to come do their bit by opening up their workplaces.
