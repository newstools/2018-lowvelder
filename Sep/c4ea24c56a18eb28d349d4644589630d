 MBOMBELA – Have you ever wondered why some of the trees in town are wrapped in pink? Or have you ever wondered how you could wear a traditional doek on your head? Well, CANSA Lowveld has the answers to these questions. “We cover the tree in pink as part of our Pink Trees for Pauline (PTFP) initiative, that will start in September,” explains Mandisa Mthembu, divisional coordinator: service delivery (Mpumalanga). This is one of the fund-raising initiatives from the organisation. Interested parties can buy the material to cover the trees at any CANSA branch and those covered in pink in turn create awareness for cancer. This year they have decided to add an extra component to this initiative, namely #doekwithadiffrence.

A doek can be purchased from CANSA for only R70. Women (or even men) are encouraged to wear them every Friday in September to create even more awareness for cancer. LEES OOK: CANSA launches new support group This campaign is a natural extension of the PTFP slogan “Wrapped in colour, united in hope” and aims to raise funds specifically for care and support programmes for cancer patients and those affected by the disease.
