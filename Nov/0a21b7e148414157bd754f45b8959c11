The spokesman for the national Department of Basic Education, Elijah Mhlanga recently explained that supplementary exams will be scrapped completely and replaced with a second national examination period in May and June. Mhlanga said this is an effort to improve the matric pass rate and create more opportunities for learners. “We want to create a better opportunity for more people. We found that of those that qualified, fewer registered and even smaller numbers actually came through to sit for the supplementary exams, simply because they didn’t have enough time to prepare for them,” he said.
