 The recent research, restoration and extension of the old Jock Trek 1885 tourism route, nominated for an award, was never a commercial venture, but a heritage contribution of something unique to the Lowveld, to its people and its tourism industry. This heritage tourism route with its 36 waymarkers, traversing the escarpment and the Lowveld to the border with Mozambique, was the initiative of Mpumalanga Heritage, a registered non-profit members’ organisation formed to conserved local heritage and history. The project leader was the local general practitioner Dr Gerrit Haarhoff and the research done coincided with his book recently published on the subject, Forgotten Tracks and Trails of the Escarpment and the Lowveld. These historic routes, one starting in Lydenburg and the other in Barberton, were the same travelled by the transport rider and politician Percy Fitzpatrick, accompanied by his dog Jock, later made famous in the book, Jock of The Bushveld, a world-acclaimed literary classic. Recently, travel writers and tour operators were invited to take part in the launch excursion. The development of a heritage tour along these routes, as a commercial venture for tour operators, is currently under development.
