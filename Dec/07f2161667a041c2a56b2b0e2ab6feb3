 BARBERTON – The Democratic Alliance Women’s Network (DAWN) has called for the reinstatement of the SAPS special victim empowerment centres within the police station in the City of Mbombela Local Municipality (CMLM). This call was made by Annerie Weber, provincial chairman for the network in Mpumalanga. Weber, accompanied by the party councillors, which included Cllr Elsabe Jacobs, Cllr Kleinste Janse van Rensburg and Cllr Trudie Grove, visited the Umjindi Victim Empowerment Centre (UVEC) on Tuesday, where they also submitted a memorandum of demands to the Barberton SAPS. The event forms part of DAWN’s 16 Days of Activism for No Violence Against Women and Children
The UVEC is a non-profit organisation and its offices are situated under the same roof as the Barberton SAPS. According to Weber, the CMLM has always been plagued by sexual assault, and the amount of reported crimes increased this year.

It is unacceptable that a decision was taken to close the unit despite an increasing trend over the past five years,” said Weber. She said police officials who are assigned for rape cases cover a vast area, and are therefore affected by a shortage of trained staff to handle these cases. “The police response rates are poor in the municipality and this is often affected by a shortage of vehicles and staff that have to service the whole of the CMLM,” added Weber. She then read out the memorandum of demands, which was accepted by Col Clementine Mayisela on behalf of the Barberton SAPS. DAWN also donated two boxes of cakes as a token of appreciation to the Barberton SAPS for their wonderful support toward UVEC. They further donated 30 care packs to UVEC, which were sponsored by Mopani Pharmacy.
