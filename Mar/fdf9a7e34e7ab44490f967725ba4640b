 The Easter long weekend is just around the corner and should be a time of fun and spending quality time with the family, not worrying about your home and possessions. According to Stuart Clarkson, executive manager of Fidelity ADT, Easter weekend has become a prime opportunity for criminals. “These crimes are not always traditional house break-ins while residents are away but also include driveway hijackings and robberies, and break-ins while residents are entertaining or sleeping in their homes,” said Clarkson.

Like all household appliances, your alarm needs to be tested regularly.” Getting your security in order also includes making sure your security provider has access to your property in the event of an emergency. “If you don’t have an access solution in place, such as a lock box for example, speak to your security provider about what your options are. There is nothing more frustrating for a security provider and a resident if no one can get into the property to assist when a resident is away on holiday, for instance.” Also read: UPDATE: R538 to Numbi Gate still closed due to protests He adds that parents who need to leave children at home during the holidays should educate them on security and what to do in an emergency. Clarkson encourages parents of teens to lay down some basic rules to ensure their safety while at home alone. “Make sure your teens understand that if they are having friends over they need to talk to you about it first. Teens should also be conscious of security when hanging around outside the gate or in the street. Criminals won’t hesitate to take advantage of a gate standing open. If they are heading to a mall or public place, they need to make sure that they have proper plans and are in a group,” he advises. Also read: Kishugu Lowveld Air Show launch 2018
