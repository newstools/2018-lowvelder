 MBOMBELA – Lowvelder readers have less than a week to correctly piece together the graffiti puzzle that has been popping up across Mbombela. Two tickets to the show, as well as a whopping R1 500 in cash, could be yours. The riddler has targeted local shopping centres and prominent businesses to convey the message of one of the biggest events on the Lowveld calender, the Kishugu Lowveld Air Show. In his works of art lie a hidden message. In his last piece at Kishugu’s head office at Nelspruit Airfield, the message is larger than life. You have until Tuesday to correctly guess the answer. If you want to experience the deafening roar of fighter jet engines, the “whump-whump” of helicopter blades and the turbocharged growl of peak-performance sports cars, it is time to enter the competition on www.lowvelder.co.za, if you have not done so already. Enter here: Graffiti mystery still unsolved You will find all the works of art done by the mysterious artist on the Lowvelder website. Spectators are in for an all-day and all-night rocking performance this year, both in the air and on the ground. Lowvelders are always eager for family-friendly and value-for-money events and on Saturday, May 12 that is exactly what visitors can expect.
