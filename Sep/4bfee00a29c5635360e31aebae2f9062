 A particular focus for CANSA is that of the teenage cancer survivors (patients). Currently, adolescents are under-represented in the National Cancer Registry and the South African Children’s Cancer Registry, so the true incidence of  cancer in the country is not known.

They struggle to manage themselves while their lives are threatened. There are high rates of depression among teen patients, but it’s often undiagnosed,” Geel says. The CANSA Tough Living with Cancer (TLC) children/teens’ support programme embraces a holistic approach to include the emotional and social well-being of parents (guardians), children or teens and their siblings.
