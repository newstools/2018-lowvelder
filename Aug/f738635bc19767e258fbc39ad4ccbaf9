Master Maths and Master Science classes have been designed for grade 4 to 12 pupils that need a bit of extra help, or would just like to better their existing report marks. This well established franchise’s approach is based on a progressive method of teaching mathematics and science. Their unique method of integrating personal contact from tutors with interactive computer lessons is what sets them apart from other maths or science tuition services. Lessons are authored by highly competent teachers who interpret the South African curriculum and convert it into a user friendly and easy to understand format. Lesson content is regularly updated according to changes in the curriculum and CAPS document.
