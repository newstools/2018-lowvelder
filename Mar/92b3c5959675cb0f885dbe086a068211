 MATSULU – A young man has vanished into thin air after notifying his family that he was being followed. According to police spokesman Sgt Gerald Sedibe, Mziwakhe Prince Makwakwa (23) was reported missing since February 8. Mziwakhe Prince Makwakwa “He went to Durban to attend the Durban University of Technology (DUT). While there he phoned a family member and told them he was being followed by some people. He was attempting to get to a police station for help.
