 The South African Weather Service alerted the public on 12 October regarding the possibility of some extreme weather conditions expected to affect the central and eastern portions of the country. This extreme weather will be in the form of severe thunderstorms and possibly hail. Isolated thunderstorms are expected to develop over central and eastern South Africa, but will be scattered over western parts of KwaZulu-Natal and as well as Mpumalanga, where in places they may become severe producing hail and strong damaging winds. Thunderstorm activities are expected to persist on Saturday 13 October over the same area, with a further risk of severe storms over eastern parts of North West, north and eastern Free State, Gauteng and western Mpumalanga.  In addition to potential hail and damaging winds, there is also a likelihood for localised heavy downpours leading to incidents of flash flooding for the abovementioned areas. The public in these areas are advised to exercise extreme caution. Conditions will improve somewhat on Sunday 14 October, however there still remains a risk of isolated storms in some areas.  Furthermore,  The South African Weather Service urges the public to regularly follow weather forecasts on television and radio.
