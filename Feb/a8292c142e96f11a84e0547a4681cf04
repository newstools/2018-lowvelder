Sources say the autopsy showed Von Johnston had a gunshot wound to the head and numerous others to his body. Ntimane was shot in the back of the head. Sedibe initially confirmed that a man had handed himself over to police shortly after the incident. He claimed that he had been attacked by the victims. Von Johnston’s neighbour, Mark Norris (39), spent the night of the incident in police custody. He arrived at the Barberton Magistrate’s Court the next morning in the back of a police vehicle after a visit to a doctor and was escorted to the holding cells. Norris was released without appearing in court or being charged. Sedibe said once their investigation was completed, it would be handed back to the National Prosecuting Authority for evaluation.
