MBOMBELA – One of the city’s finest has retired from the police. Capt Dawie Pretorius, who was the communications spokesman for the Nelspruit police for 18 years, stepped down last Wednesday. A Free State boy, he was transferred to Hazyview in 1978. He had never even heard of the town, but the Lowveld quickly became his home for life.
