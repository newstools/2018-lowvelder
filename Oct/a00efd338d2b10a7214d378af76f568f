 BARBERTON – The High Court sitting in Mbombela will tomorrow (Friday, October 26) hear an application from former City of Mbombela Local Municipality councillor, Mandla Mamba, for bail. His legal representative, Maxhosa Lab, drafted a notice of appeal against the judgement of the Barberton Magistrate’s Court to refuse him bail. Mamba is facing nine charges of fraud and one for attempted murder. He has been behind bars since June. He is currently incarcerated at Nelspruit Correctional Services.

On Monday, supporters of Mamba congregated in their numbers, singing struggle songs. They wanted him to be granted bail as they claimed that there was no case against Mamba for lack of proof. Innocent “Mlopies” Nkambule, one of the supporters, said they believed that Mamba has been framed. “The cases of fraud are baseless. There is no one who came forward presenting proof that he was defrauded by Mamba. These cases are political motivated. We know that there are individuals out there who want to destroy Mamba,” said Nkambule. His appeal will be heard in the High Court on Friday.
