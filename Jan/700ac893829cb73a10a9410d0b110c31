 “Our economy has many sectors, and businesses across all these sectors are desperate for young people who are technically qualified and experienced to fill a host of positions. Many of these positions don’t require someone who studied towards a degree, but rather someone who studied towards a qualification that gave them the technical expertise and the workplace readiness to be an asset from day one.” That is according to Elbie Liebenberg, principal at Oxbridge Academy. This academy is a brand of ADvTECH, Africa’s largest private education provider. According to Liebenberg there is still too much of a fixation on degree study as the only solid path towards a sustainable career. Here are some career sectors that don’t require degree studies: Tourism and hospitality “You only need to be eighteen years old with Grade 10 to pursue an Occupational Certificate as Chef, or an International City and Guilds IVQ Level 2 in Patisserie,” says. Deon Roets, Academic Head at Capsicum Culinary School. Event or Hospitality Management “These qualifications are intensive, work-focused ones which cover a broad spectrum of competencies, including accounting, sales and marketing, leadership, and HR Management and Business Communications, and will set you up for a successful future in the industry,” says Liebenberg.
