SABIE – Participating in the White River 64 Round Table Tube Race this year means diving into bucketloads of fun.
The “race” will take place next weekend (February 9-11), so get your Superhero Illuminate outfit and your tube ready to drift down the Sabie River with hundreds, if not thousands, of other adventurers.
Capt Pottie Potgieter from White River Search and Rescue, who will be in charge of safety, will clear the river of any debris this week, in collaboration with York Timbers.
“The river’s level is perfect for the race, despite a few spots that might cause some snags,” said Potgieter.
Swift Nkomazi Ambulance Services, Phoenix Security and Nelspruit Concerned Citizens will also be present to ensure safety.
Eight trucks will transport the tubers to the starting line, up the river. For those itching to get on the dance floor, two stages will host Die Horries, ZionRuts Family and DJ Jaydon just to mention a few. A cash bar and food stalls will be available.
A weekend pass will cost you R350, which includes a camping spot at Castle Rock. Day visitors can join in the fun for R150.
You can either bring your own tube or buy one at Castle Rock at R160 for a medium-sized one, and R260 for a larger one. Supa Quick Sabie will again have a stand where they can be inflated.
York Timbers will set up a free pancake stand at the start and there will be a water point with some entertainment halfway.
One of the organisers, Gert Delport, urges tubers to drink lots of water and wear sunscreen and takkies at all times.
“The river is flowing well and we are expecting some rain before the race,” he said.
The money raised will be donated to charities around Sabie. Enquiries: www.sabietuberace.co.za. Last year, White River 64 Round Table Tube Race saw 2 000 brave the river More photos of the fun at the great Sabie Tube Race
