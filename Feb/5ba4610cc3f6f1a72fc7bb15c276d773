 MBOMBELA – His performance incorporated elements of all genres, bringing together glimmering sound effects and vocals. His carefully crafted sound is almost hypnotic in a way, luring the listener deeper into the heart of his music. Barbosa was one of the featured artists on the line-up in a music festival in Brazil recently, where he performed with the top-17 bands in that part of the world. The Mozambican, who is now based in Pretoria, performed songs such as “Bhuti Ngihamba Nawe”, “Fight or Talk About It” and “Naka Mokadzi” which means “a beautiful woman”.
On April 7 Barbosa will perform at the Lekkerland Carnival at The Village Green in Dullstroom, alongside the likes of Karen Zoid, who will headline the show, joined by Matthew Mole, Refentse, Adelle Nqeto and Bouwer Bosch.
The family-friendly carnival includes a kiddies’ zone with entertainment by the BDI Street Performance Troupe including jugglers and stilt walkers. There will also be stalls, carnival food, a bar, great music and craft beer tents for the grown folk. This year there will be a multitude of unplugged live music sessions at a selection of restaurants and venues on the Friday and Sunday. On Saturday the Lekkerland Carnival kicks off at 10:00. Tickets include access to selected unplugged shows on April 6 and 8 and are available on lekkerland.co.za.
