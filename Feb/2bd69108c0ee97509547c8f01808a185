James Aling, chairman of the Mbombela Economic Development Partnership explained that the private business sector is very well organised and represented by the various business associations and partnerships. He raised service delivery, illegal land invasions, high unemployment and growing levels of dissatisfaction among local communities as some of the challenges facing the local economy. According to Aling these can only be addressed in a collaborative and partnership manner, which the private sector is willing to do. Diamond discussed the municipality’s current dire financial situation and confirmed that it will take up to five years to turn it around through decreasing municipal expenditure and improving internal management controls. He also requested the private sector to do its part to ensure that the City of Mbombela succeeds and thrives. The groups agreed to have the “Let’s Talk” sessions on a quarterly basis to follow up on progress, problems and new opportunities. READ MORE: Local Economic Development – is it happening here?
