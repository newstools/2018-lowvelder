 While Eskom has not implemented rotational loadshedding this morning, an alert for Stage 1 rotational loadshedding from 5pm to 9pm has been issued. Load shedding will only be implemented as a last resort once all other emergency reserves have been exhausted. Also read: Why Eskom is loadshedding Please switch off geysers as well as all non-essential lighting and electricity appliances to assist in reducing demand. In the event that loadshedding becomes necessary, Eskom and the municipalities will use the published rotational loadshedding schedules. For Eskom customers, these schedules are available on the Eskom website (http://loadshedding.eskom.co.za). Eskom customers can also contact the customer contact centre at 0860 037 566. Eskom will provide regular updates on the status of the power system through all media platforms.
