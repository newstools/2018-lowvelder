 MBOMBELA – Coetzee was charged with theft in 2015 after an Audi that was stored on his property was removed from its storage place. According to Coetzee at that time, those charges were the result of a great misunderstanding. The case is continuing in court. He was out on a bail of R1 500. He was arrested again on Wednesday for various fraud cases which were committed between 2017 and 2018. Nelspruit police spokesman Capt Zandile Gqawa said in one incident, Coetzee acted as a sales agent and lured a victim to trade in two vehicles, a Ford Ranger and a Ford Eco Sport, for a Toyota Fortuner. “The paperwork was done and the victim got the Fortuner, but later she received a message from the bank informing her that she still owes the bank.” In another incident, Coetzee allegedly sold one Bobcat machine to three different people. Police are still investigating other cases, which include vehicle and insurance fraud and envisage that more charges would be added.  Anyone with information can contact Dt Sgt Michael Horn on 081-815-8566 or 013-759-1286.
