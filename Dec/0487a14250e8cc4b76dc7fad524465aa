 It’s the silly season and most people will be spending a significant amount of their time and money buying gifts for their beloveds. Drones, or remotely piloted aircraft (RPA) – as they are referred to by lawmakers, have been soaring in popularity in recent years; and are most likely to continue flying off the shelves this year too. Truth be told, there can be no arguing over the fact that drones are regarded by many as a must-have gadget. Similarly, a large number of the population is not fully aware that inappropriate and illegal use of these gadgets can land them in jail or with a hefty R50 000 – fine or both. First things first; is it illegal to fly a drone?
Contrary to popular misconception, it is not illegal to operate a drone in South Africa. In fact, as far back as 2015, South Africa was among one of the first, and just a handful of countries to allow the flying of drones. What’s more, in the same year, South Africa became the first country on the continent and possibly across the globe to issue a pilot’s license to operate remotely piloted aircraft. According to the South African Civil Aviation Authority (SACAA), traditionally, remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS), or drones, as they are commonly known, were initially used primarily in military operations. While these types of aircraft have been used for some considerable time in military operations, their useful deployment in civilian activities has only become more apparent in recent times. These types of aircraft thus comprise a relatively new component of the civil aviation framework. The use of RPAS has evolved rapidly and now includes various types of commercial and non-commercial activities such as conservation assignments, aerial surveillance, scientific research, journalism, etc. Basically, the use of RPAS can now be limited only by one’s imagination. It should be noted that, in line with international prescripts, RPAS are categorised as aircraft across the world. As such, RPAS must integrate with the existing and highly-organised manned aviation sector in a manner that does not present a risk to existing airspace users, citizens, or property. Notwithstanding, the rapid advancement of RPAS and their potential and unlimited use in commercial and recreational activities has caught many regulators across the world by some level of surprise. In most instances, the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) would take the lead in terms of developing Standards and Recommended Practices, which regulators would then translate into legally-enforceable local civil aviation regulations. The ICAO process is still unfolding. Is it a bird, a drone, or toy aircraft?
Popular as they are, drones are not toy aircraft. The confusion around the two has led to many people unintentionally breaking aviation and other laws. These accidental incidences can leave one with a hefty fine or a criminal record. So before you go on a bargain-hunting spree for the niftiest flying gadget, first familiarise yourself with RPAS laws, which in certain instances are applicable to all types of aircraft including toy aircraft, model aircraft and a remotely piloted aircraft. The SACAA describes a remotely piloted aircraft (RPAS) as an unmanned (or pilotless) aircraft which is piloted from a remote pilot station, excluding model aircraft and toy aircraft. On the other hand a toy aircraft is defined as a product falling under the definition of aircraft but which is designed or intended for use in play by children. The SACAA describes another category termed model aircraft which relates to a non-human-carrying aircraft capable of sustained flight in the atmosphere and used exclusively for air display, recreational use, sport or competitions. This article focuses on remotely piloted aircraft. Don’t be the one who accidentally causes an aviation accident
In any given country, the airspace is used by a multitude of operators who operate a variety of aircraft and flying mechanisms, including hot air balloons. All these require the individual(s) operating the devise(s) to be competent and in possession of a valid pilot’s licence. They also require the flying devise to be registered with the relevant authorities, and to be in an airworthy condition. This is the reason why authorities want to regulate RPAS; meaning they are taking reasonable precautionary steps to ensure that the levels of aviation safety and security are not compromised. Given that we have over 13 000 aircraft on the South African Aircraft Register, our country’s airspace is relatively congested and busy with a variety of operations, including among others, helicopters, recreational aircraft, hot air balloons as well as jets carrying large numbers of passengers. As much as drones are cool gadgets, they also pose risks and if not operated in line with applicable laws may cause a collision with other aircraft, with possible fatal results. Drones can also cause damage to property or injury to members of the public. Moreover, individuals that use RPAS in an irresponsible manner may also face legal liability for breaking laws enforceable by other authorities; for instance, laws pertaining to privacy. Given the low cost and availability of these aircraft, it is possible that errant individuals or entities may easily obtain and utilise these aircraft in an unsafe manner, thus presenting a risk to other aviators and the public. Regardless, the SACAA will never condone nor tolerate any form of blatant disregard of the applicable rules. We urge the public to report these errant individuals or entities to the SACAA or the South African Police Service (SAPS) for investigation and enforcement action. Don’t fly yourself into a legal storm – a quick guide to do’s and don’ts DO’S
• Fly/operate Remotely Piloted Aircraft, or toy aircraft in a safe manner, at all times.
• Remotely Piloted Aircraft or toy aircraft should remain within the visual line of sight at all times.
• Fly/operate RPA in daylight and clear weather conditions.
• Inspect your device before each flight. The SACAA also urges RPAS pilots and operators to adhere to the limitations and restrictions as outlined in the regulations, notably that:
• the RPAS should be in a fit-to-fly condition with the relevant authorisation;
• the person flying the RPAS is the holder of a valid Remote Pilot’s Licence;
• the aircraft is not flown in a formation or swarm;
• the aircraft is not flown 400ft above the surface or within a radius of 10 kilometres from an airport.
• the aircraft is not flown adjacent to or above a nuclear power plant, prison, police station, crime scene, court of law, national key point or strategic installation. DON’TS
Do not, through act or omission, endanger the safety of another aircraft or person therein or any person or property through negligent flying/operation of remotely piloted aircraft, or toy aircraft. Don’t fly/operate Remotely Piloted Aircraft, or toy aircraft 50 metre or closer from:
• Any person or group of persons (like sports field, road races, schools, social events, etc.)
• Any property without permission from the property owner. Unless approved by the SACAA, don’t fly/operate Remotely Piloted Aircraft or toy aircraft:
• Near manned aircraft
• 10 km or closer to an aerodrome (airport, helipad, airfield)
• Weighing more than 7 kilograms
• In controlled or restricted or prohibited airspace. Do not fly/operate remotely piloted aircraft, or toy aircraft higher than 150ft from the ground, unless approved by the Director of Civil Aviation of the SACAA. No remotely piloted aircraft (RPA) shall be operated, unless such an RPA is registered with the SACAA and has been issued with a letter of approval. In addition, retailers need to note that no RPA shall be sold unless the seller has notified the buyer of the operational requirements as imposed by the SACAA. Operators and owners of RPAS need to familiarise themselves with the applicable operational requirements, which indicate, among others, that no person shall operate an RPAS unless that person has been issued with a valid remote pilot licence. In a nutshell, an RPAS pilot has the responsibility to ensure that the aircraft is operated safely and does not endanger the safety of another aircraft, person, property, nor invade on the privacy and security of any other member of the public. Overall no individual or entity may operate an RPAS for commercial, corporate, or non-profit purposes unless they have a valid RPAS Operator Certificate. However, private or recreational users of RPASs are not required to undergo the same certification process as other operational categories provided that there is no exchange of favours or any form of financial gain in exchange for flying. RPAS regulations further prohibit:
• The flying of an RPAS in weather conditions that do not allow unobstructed visual contact to be maintained with the RPAS by the operator and other airspace users, unless in approved beyond visual line-of-sight or night operations;
• The use of a public road as a place of landing or take-off of an RPAS; For private use, the RPAS may only be used for an individual’s personal and private purposes where there is no commercial outcome, interest or gain. However, the drone regulations which are contained in Part 101 of the South African Civil Aviation Regulations, contain other restrictions which are designed to keep the general public safe. For all other uses an RPA must be registered and may only be operated in terms of Part 101 of the South African Civil Aviation Regulations. To date, the SACAA has registered 1 224 RPAS on the aircraft register and has issued 1 156 remote pilot’s licences. There are five schools allowed to conduct RPAS pilot training.
