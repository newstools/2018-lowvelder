 MBOMBELA – Thursday was the deadline for the widening of Friedenheim Road, yet not a lot is happening on site, much to the chagrin of motorists and local business owners. What is more, it seems like a minimum waiting period of at least six more weeks is imminent. Here’s how the closure of Fredenheim Road might affect you Construction on the road began in May 2017 and has since been plagued by delays. Local businessman Willem Venter, who was previously agitated by the road works, is now fuming. Your notice stated that the road will be closed until October 18 which was Thursday. At this stage it is obvious that the road isn’t open, as construction is far from completed,” said Venter. Lowvelder visited the site on deadline day, and still, nothing much has been happening despite the City of Mbombela spokesman Joseph Ngala’s confirmation that the contractor has been paid in full.
When the workers were asked if they will be continuing with the construction, their answer was “Not today,” without providing a reason for the construction coming to a halt yet again.
“During the last two weeks very little action has taken place on this project. Machine operators and drivers are sitting sleeping in their vehicles and machines for the whole day. It is the most filthy construction site I have ever witnessed.
“We have already instructed our lawyers to institute legal action,” said Venter. Also read: Six accidents, two fatalities in the last 24 hours
