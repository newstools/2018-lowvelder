Janó will tackle a 16 500km-journey through South Africa and neighboring countries (nine in total) on a 2015 Honda XR150.

For the rest, it will be about people, new places, and many experiences from which I will gain personal growth, insight and wisdom.” Well, when you read this, Janó will be on his way through Swaziland.
