 As part of Mandela’s Centenary celebrations, the Sabie Chamber of Commerce and Tourism (SCCT) has decided to undertake an ambitious project for the youth of Sabie. This not only includes Sabie, but Harmony Hill and Simile which is part of this beautiful town. In a brief ceremony at the tennis courts on Wednesday, the chamber’s Gwilym Rees shared their vision and told stakeholders that they chose this venue as it is central and easily accessible to Sabie, Simile and Harmony Hill residents alike. Therefore, it is accessible to all, without exception or favour.”The courts are in a totally dilapidated state and the land is being wasted, where it could be put to good use for our youth,” Rees said. Gwilym Rees addressing the stakeholders. Last year, the chamber had approached the municipality saying that every year the SCCT receives a donation from the White River Round Table, for them to use towards a community project in Sabie, in memory of Nelson Mandela. “Generally, the youth is our focus because that is where our future lies,”said Rees.
In 2015, it renovated parts of the Harmony Hill School and the year after, Lindani and Memezile Schools in Simile.
“Our project for 2017 was mooted to be a renovation of the four tennis courts in Sabie (situated near the Municipal Offices) and the conversion into a safe and accessible sports area for our youth to engage in healthy activities and thus be off the streets. At the moment, there is nowhere for the Sabie youth to recreate in any positive and well-defined manner. This obviously leads to disruptive behaviour and general negativity within our youth,” he said. They proposed the conversion of the four courts into different activities. The chamber had the following in mind:
• Re-surface all four courts
• Create gardens surrounding them
• Establishment of a jungle gym near the derelict club house
• Renovate the fencing surrounding the courts
• Re-establish the high-pole lights over the courts
• Establishing a “graffiti wall” and running a quarterly competition amongst the Youth for the best graffiti, with prizes
• Renovation of the derelict “club house”, grand stand and toilet facilities
• Establishment of a spectator area under the shade trees near the “club house”
• Possible establishment of a refreshment kiosk
– Establishing:
• One tennis court.
• One basketball / netball court
• One “fitness park” (modelled along the lines of those erected all over Johannesburg by the Municipality
• One skateboard / rollerblade track Rees added that this will require a significant amount of private sector and other stakeholder financial input as well as a lot of work from the chamber side.
“The area is currently derelict and presents an ideal opportunity for our Youth to benefit, as well as demonstrating Thaba Chweu Local Municipality, to whom the courts belong to’s commitment to our Sabie Community,” he said.  “This is an ideal opportunity to demonstrate a spirit of bridge building and co-operation between government (TCLM) and the private sector and moreover, this might well become a model that other towns would be proud to emulate in the future,” he said. “We cannot do this until we have TCLM’s agreement in principle, to do so,” Rees said.
