 WHITE RIVER – Jeremy Loops doesn’t play the Lowveld often, but when he does his shows sell out. What a jol it was.      With Motheo Moleko on vocals, Mr Sakitumi on bass, Hiram Koopman on sax and Devin Jones on drums, Loops offered his young fans and adults alike, old hits and new songs from his latest and third album Critical as water, which dropped this year. The single off it “Waves” has been driving audiences mad.

These were some of the band’s last gigs in South Africa before they embark on a tour of Germany. If Thursday and Friday were anything to go by, the Europeans are in for a treat. Barnyard owner Steven Hyson said the Friday night tickets sold out three weeks after Jeremy Loops announced they were coming to the Lowveld. They even added more and then the band agreed to the second show, which almost sold out. “They are just so popular,” Hyson said. “It was a great show. Everyone enjoyed themselves.” ALSO READ: BosRock heads for the Lowveld
