 MBOMBELA – A total of 158 more rhinos managed to escape the greed of poachers in the Kruger National Park (KNP) in 2017 than in 2016. In combating this heinous crime 29 more alleged poachers were arrested inside and adjacent to the park than in 2016. The number of these activities in the KNP decreased by 7,6 per cent, from 2 883 recorded incidents in 2016 to 2 662 in 2017, indicating a successful implementation of anti-poaching strategies. Minister of environmental affairs, Dr Edna Molewa, announced these and other statistics related to the progress of the implementation of the integrated management of rhinos on January 25. Nationally the situation looks less rosy with 1 028 of these animals poached, 26 less than the 1 054 in 2016.
Fewer poachers were arrested too: 518 in 2017 compared with 680 in 2016. Molewa warned that the 24 per cent decrease in rhinos lost in the Kruger (from 662 in 2016 to 504 in 2017) does not mean that the battle has been won yet.  “The success in the KNP does not give cause for complacency or allows us to be less vigilant,” she said.
Rhino poaching remains a national priority crime, with the 67 elephants poached in the park last year raising a new concern. Her report covered areas in line with the integrated strategic management approach, namely compulsory interventions and managing rhino populations, as well as long-term sustainability and new interventions. She said the intensive protection-zone approach allows them to allocate resources to ensure maximum safeguarding in areas of greatest importance. A patrol-optimisation programme with intelligence-driven allocation of patrol resources was initiated in high-risk areas in the parks. She lauded the South African National Defence Force as a strategic partner in the anti-poaching team, as it is crucial in assisting with border integrity and support to the SAPS and rangers. These joint operations are coordinated in a Mission Area Joint Operations Centre (Majoc). Operations Rhino (1 to 7) coordinated anti-poaching operations in cooperation with the mentioned security agencies and the number of convictions related to rhino poaching within the mission area of Operation Rhino 8, centralised in the Majoc in the KNP increased from 58 in 2016 to 111 in 2017. A total of 220 weapons was seized in rhino-related incidents both inside and outside the Kruger in 2017.
Molewa admitted that 21 officials were arrested for poaching-related offences, hence SANParks has instituted a programme of integrity testing throughout the organisation. The Directorate for Priority Crime Investigations (DPCI or Hawks) arrested 16 level-three to -four wildlife traffickers, including couriers, local buyers and exporters of South-East Asian, South African, Mozambican, Zimbabwean and Kenyan origin, and confiscated 168,46 kilograms of rhino horn. The coordinated efforts between DPCI, the South African Revenue Service Customs and Excise, supported by the environmental management inspectors led to the dismantling of 35 trafficking networks linking the transit countries of Swaziland, Mozambique, Namibia and Kenya to the end-user countries in Asia. During 2017 there were eight seizures of rhino horn at OR Tambo International Airport. Molewa said SANParks continues to manage populations by translocating them away from high-risk poaching areas.
Logistical arrangements were recently announced for the translocation of a small group of black rhinos to Zakouma National Park in Chad. Initiatives relating to the biological management of populations were developed through the Rhino Lab in August 2016, leading to a number of interventions to further promote conservation. At a workshop in 2017 a national research strategy for white and black rhinos was developed. In 2017 the rhino-guardian programme was initiated in the KNP. It entails surrogacy for orphans, as well as guardianship and detailed monitoring of black rhinos in specific areas. Molewa thanked the rangers as the real heroes who remain at the front line in the fight. She called on the public to report any suspicious activities to the environmental crime hotline on 0800-205-005 or the SAPS number on 10111.
