 This school enrols learners with mild to moderate learning barriers, as well as those in high need of support. Debbie Mills said that since it is a special-needs school, every learner got a prize. “We acknowledged every child. We focus on various things that they are excel in.  Even if they have disabilities, they can achieve so much in life. They are good in so many things. For example, they did the decorations for this event,” she said.

Mills said that some learners have completed their studies and have nowhere to go. “There are 32 kids and now they have acquired skills but they do not know what to do.   We have been trying to assist them to get projects or placements so that they can do something after this, but we have not succeeded. I would like to urge locals to help us help the kids so that they can also have a future,” she added.

Ntini said that as mother she knows the frustration of not knowing the future for a child.  “I know assisting the kids and their families will give them hope. It is not easy to raise a child with disabilities and this is why I made sure that I am part of this initiative,” she said.  The school is in need of a kitchen.
