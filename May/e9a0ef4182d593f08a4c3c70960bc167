 The City of Mbombela Local Municipality (CMLM) is investigating people who seemingly claimed a section of municipal ground on the KaNyamazane road outside Mbombela. They divided the land among themselves, using a tape. CMLM spokesman Joseph Ngala said they called the police as soon as they were informed.  “We went there with the police after we heard that there was a land grab on the area which we have allocated for Tekwane Urban Hub.
