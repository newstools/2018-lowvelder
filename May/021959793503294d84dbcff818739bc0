 HAZYVIEW – Hi-Tech Security Lowveld operations manager, Callum MacPherson, said the team came across two abandoned bakkie loads of avos. The second occurred during a special operation on a farm in the Kiepersol area on Saturday night. The first was two days prior, when the team acted on a tip-off.

Both recoveries were on the same farm and valued at between R20 000 and R25 000. “You can clearly see the difference between a thief who picks it and a farmer who cuts it to keep the stems on so that they last longer for export,” MacPherson explained. Lowvelder reported earlier this year that crime syndicates had set their sights on the Lowveld’s avocados and how the trade in stolen fruit was adversely affecting the industry.

Although theft has been a long-standing problem, it has increased exponentially over the last five years and methods are becoming more sophisticated. The extent of incidents indicates that they are orchestrated by syndicates, despite the heightened security measures installed by farmers. MacPherson added that it was the beginning of the harvesting season and they expected a lot more incidents in the coming weeks. “We have special services with the aim of preventing it,” he said.
