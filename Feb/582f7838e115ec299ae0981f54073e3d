 MBOMBELA – Sentech, the service provider responsible for radio signal distribution, got its lines crossed on Tuesday morning. RSG and 5FM listeners were surprised to find stations other than their usual preferred listening being broadcast on their frequencies. The situation at RSG was quickly rectified, but 5FM listeners were treated to a prolonged listening of MotswedingFM.

We only picked up a problem with the contents a bit later, after the upgrade and the repair process was initiated. “We have restored RSG, in the Mbombela area, to the correct frequency. “With regards to 5Fm, the service was off air earlier due to a transmitter fault which has been restored. However even after restoration of the service the content problem still remains.* Sentech s busy resolving this problem and three services have been restored thus far.” *This article has been edited since first being published. 5FM has since also been restored.
