 MSHOLOZI – The demolition of structures that were built illegally at Mama Esther’s Haven Centre, which has been earmarked for a school construction, started on Tuesday. The structures are being torn down to pave way for a school. Most of them are shacks while a few are built with bricks.  Becony Maluka, chairman of the school governing body, said most of these houses are occupied by the people who used to stay at Mama Esther’s Haven Centre.

They were told that this site is earmarked for a school, but they continued to build their structures. An eviction order was also issued to them but they defied it,” said Maluka. Tuesday marked the second day of the disruption of teaching and learning at Boschrand. Parents and learners from the school took to the streets on Monday demanding that the Department of Education move the school’s mobile classrooms from privately owned land to the centre. Police are monitoring the situation.
