 MBOMBELA –  Deanne Kim who is an upcoming South African contemporary artist will be exhibiting her work. Since her last exhibition at the Mbombela Agricultural Show hosted at the Show Grounds in August this year, she started a group for Mpumalanga underprivileged and unexposed artists. They have attended many Imbizo’s over the past view months and going from strength to strength on their own expense but never giving up. Recently this has paid off as they recently been invited to exhibit some of their artworks at the William Braemer Fine Art Gallery in Wynwood Miami, Florida, USA next year.  Kim studied art for a total of 12 years. Her style varies from fine art to contemporary. As a talented artist, she is extremely versatile in creating any forms ranging from wildlife, portraiture, botanical to various miscellaneous objects.
The exhibition will open at 18:00 at the gallery situated in Drysdale Street. Entrance to the exhibition is free.
