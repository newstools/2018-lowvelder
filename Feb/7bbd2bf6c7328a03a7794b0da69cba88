 More than 200 swimmers from 28 clubs and schools participated in the Mpumalanga Age Group Gala at Van Riebeeck Park last weekend. According to Emile van Veenhuyzen, president of Mpumalanga Province Swimming this gala, the fifth in the series, played a critical role in allowing participants to record official event times needed to qualify for the various national level competitions which will be taking place at the end of the 12-month swimming season. “Age group galas are also critical for race training, since a swimmer can only gain critical racing experience during a competition. More advanced swimmers and coaches also use this opportunity to determine the progress of the swimmer and if changes are required in the swimmer’s training programme,” he said.
