Absolutely any and every kind of performer is welcome to show their stuff and tell their story.

On Friday, Cooper and Sefatsa will mentor each finalist in preparation for the big show. Saturday will bring the final competition. It will be presented at the hall for a live, local audience. It will be all up to the performers’ fellow community members – including friends, family, co-workers and neighbours – to choose the victor, who will be awarded R10 000 and a glittering trophy cup that will signify that they are their town’s favourite act. The programme will be as follows:
Day 1 – Audition day – only one day of auditions – top four are picked.
Day 2 – Mentor day – rehearsal and coaching day
Day 3 – Final show – town vote for the top act.
