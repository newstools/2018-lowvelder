 MBOMBELA – Rapist Given Senzo Lekhuleni (22) was sentenced to 20 years’ imprisonment in the Nelspruit Regional Court on Monday. He had raped a 40-year-old woman at knifepoint in 2016. On April 18 that year, his victim was crossing the Curlews Road on her way to a convenience store. He grabbed her by her ponytail and placed a knife against her throat. Lekhuleni forced her into the bush and raped her. When he was done, he robbed her of R45. Read more on his previous court appearance here. Last Thursday he was found guilty on two counts, these being rape and robbery with aggravating circumstances. On Monday magistrate Venessa Joubert sentenced Lekhuleni to 20 years’ imprisonment. She stated that he was a danger to society and pointed out that he showed no remorse for his actions. Ten years – the legally prescribed minimum sentence for rape – were imposed. Another 10 were added for the robbery.
In her judgement Joubert found that Lekhuleni had provided the court with sufficient grounds to deviate from a 15-year-sentence, as is provided for by legislation. “The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) welcomes the sentence with the hope that it will send a strong message to would-be rapists who prey on defenceless women and children,” said NPA spokesman, Monica Nyuswa.
