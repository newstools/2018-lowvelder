 Did you know… should you or a loved one be injured in an accident (except for when the driver was the cause of the accident), or you are a dependant of a deceased victim in a motor vehicle accident, you could possibly submit a claim against the Road Accident Fund. The Road Accident Fund is a public entity which is funded by our fuel levy included in the petrol and diesel prices. The purpose of the Road Accident Fund is to compensate for the loss or damages due to physical injuries as a result of the negligent driving of vehicles on South African roads. If the identity of the negligent/guilty driver, or owner of the vehicle involved, is known, the claim must be submitted within three years of the date of the accident. This is not applicable when it comes to claims of a minor. In the event that the person‘s identity is unknown, the claim must be submitted within two years. Should you require more information about your rights as a motor vehicle accident victim, contact Yvonne Kruger Inc. on 011-468-5088 or visit our website www.yki.co.za or ykruger@yki.co.za.
