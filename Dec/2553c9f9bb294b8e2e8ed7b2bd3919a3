 MBOMBELA – It seemed it was going to be a bleak Christmas. The vital tool he needed for his trade was failing him and itself. Thulani Sibande (21), from Clau Clau, is a busker. He is well known outside popular spots such as the Jock Pub & Grill, Dros and Riverside Mall, singing rock songs with his raspy voice, accompanied by the strumming of his trusty guitar. However with the long-term wear and tear and little budget for maintenance, the instrument was simply failing the partnership. Strings were missing and so old that the instrument could no longer be accurately tuned. Then Thulani was caught in the thunderstorm last Saturday. His guitar got wet and was rendered unplayable. His only source of income was broken.  Manager of Harry Green Music World,  RJ Nel came to hear of Thulani’s predicament and without hesitation offered to help the young man. An appointment was made and on Tuesday Thulani and his guitar were welcomed to the shop.  Mike Briedenhann, guitar technician and online salesman, soon had the trusty instrument in his hands. He performed a full setup and service, which included cleaning, restringing and tuning. Thulani was also shown some of the tricks of the guitar-technician trade and given a pre-loved guitar strap and an Allan key. The young musician could not contain his joy. “I forgot she could sound so good. Some of the strings I had on were not even the correct strings for an acoustic guitar. The sound is so much more powerful and pure. I am so happy,” said Thulani.  He will now be back at his favourite spots on Friday and Saturday nights, entertaining the citizens of Mbombela. His partner will be held lovingly in his hands and produce the notes, pure and powerful, that complement his voice. . Thulani taught himself to play the guitar at the age of 15. He has been earning a living as a busker for four years. He is available for gigs and corporate performances. Contact this journalist on 087-287-6927
