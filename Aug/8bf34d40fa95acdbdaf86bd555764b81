 MBOMBELA – Lowveld residents are in for a cold, rainy day as a cold front moves through the province tomorrow. Bransdy Bulo, a forecaster at the South African Weather Services (SAWS), said that even though it will be weak when it reaches the Lowveld, temperatures will still drop by at least 10 degrees. He added that the cool weather and rainy conditions will continue until Sunday, where temperatures will gradually increase to the mid 20s and early 30s again. According to SAWS, these conditions are caused by a cold front passing through from the Eastern Cape, in which cold air is drawn inland by a high pressure system.
