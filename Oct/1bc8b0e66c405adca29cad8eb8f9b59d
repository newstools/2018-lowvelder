The bomb squad was summoned to the scene and identified the device as a pipe bomb. The bomb squad detonated the device at the scene. SANParks CEO, Fundislie Mketeni, commended the rangers and K9 unit for their vigilance and swift action. “It is a reminder to all criminals that no activity will go unnoticed and unchecked in any of our parks,” he said. “It is unfortunate that South Africans who are involved in such affairs do not seem to realise they are hurting their own people and their own country, and are in the process destroying their own heritage. ‘’We urge them to come forward and inform us of who is encouraging this behaviour and to work with us to put an end to it.”
