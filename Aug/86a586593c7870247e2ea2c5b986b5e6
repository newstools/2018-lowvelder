It reports that upon investigation, tracks were found on a dust road, but were lost due to high traffic volumes in the area.  “Without more information, there isn’t much we can do. Therefore we request anyone with information to please phone their nearest police station. It is also possible that the lion might have returned to the Kruger National Park,” the MTPA said.
