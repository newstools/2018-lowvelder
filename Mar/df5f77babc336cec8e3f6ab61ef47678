 This year, on 21 April, The Citybug Challenge will be dedicated to the heroes and are drawing inspiration from an international Crossfit Hero workout named Murph. This very special workout is dedicated to Lieutenant Michael Patrick Murphy. Lieutenant Murphy was a Navy SEAL who was gunned down after he bravely abandoned cover in an effort to call for backup to save the rest of his platoon in Afghanistan. Originally written by Lieutenant Murphy, he called his gruelling workout Body of Armour – as he did it while wearing a 25-pound [11.3kg] weighted vest. After his death, the CrossFit community renamed it the Murph and added it to their collection of Hero Workouts named after fallen heroes. The Citybug Challenge will be held annually in an effort to raise funds for a worthy charity in the Nelspruit and greater Mbombela region. The management of Citybug Shuttle Service has decided that the first ever beneficiary of The Citybug Challenge will be Pro Gratia Learning Centre, who will receive all proceeds from the event.  The murph workout consists of: 1 mile run (1.6km)
100 pull-ups
200 push-ups
300 air squats
another 1 mile run (1.6km) If that sound a little above your abilities don’t worry, there are four entry classes and one of them will suit your level of fitness.
