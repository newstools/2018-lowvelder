 MBOMBELA – Allan Heyl, the last surviving member of the Stander Gang: a group of bank robbers who both appalled and enthralled South Africans in the late ’70s and early ’80s. Heyl has since penned Bank Robber: My Time with André Stander and will talk about the book and his time as a bank robber, at Lowvelder’s Pen in My Hand event on Thursday. The Stander Gang was responsible for a string of bank robberies and prison escapes in the 1980s. Heyl served more than 27 years behind bars in South Africa and England.  In Bank Robber: My Time with André Stander he recounts the bank robberies in a fast-paced, no-holds-barred, no-punches-pulled memoir. ALSO READ: Ralph Haynes raaisel word aangespreek in nuwe boek Heyl exposes the hell of prison life, revels in the sheer gung-ho audacity of robbing banks and hiding in plain sight, and reveals an inept and incompetent police force with humour, fresh insight and self-revelation. In the book he turns a critical eye on himself and the times in which he operated, taking the reader into the heart of a bank robber. Since his release from prison on May 18, 2005, Heyl has made a name for himself as a riveting speaker and he promises to keep the Pen in My Hand audience engrossed right in their backyards at A Bica coffee shop on Thursday.
