 MBOMBELA – SANBS’ local donor committee is having its second Arrested Blood Requested campaign on Saturday May 5. Less than a percentage of South Africa’s population contributes as donors and one unit of blood can save three lives. To assist SANBS in sustaining its much-needed blood supply, prominent business people in the community have been invited to be put into jail where they will be kept until a minimum of 10 people have donated blood against each person’s name. The first Arrested Blood Requested which was held in November was a huge success: they recorded donations of 148 units of blood. The committee members of SANBS will make the day as festive as possible to attract bystanders to donate and will therefore have stage and sound with entertainment throughout the day. Members of the public are urged to come and support this important initiative and donate blood to help save lives and assist SANBS in getting its stock levels up. If you consider your blood to be safe, you have the greatest gift to give another person. The event runs from 09:00 to 17:00 at the Mopani entrance of i’langa Mall. For more information on this initiative, contact Nelspruit Donor Committee chairman Yolande Nel on 083-607-2232 or admin@communio.co.za or vice-chairman Marietjie Oosthuizen on 083-296-1597 or oosthuizenmn93@gmail.com.
