 From December 2018, certain categories of child travellers will be exempt from presenting supporting documents at ports of entry. However, travellers are urged to carry these documents because they may be requested in certain instances.  Children who are foreign nationals from countries where visas are required will no longer have to carry supporting documents. This is because they would have been required to provide these during the visa application process. Children who are foreign nationals from countries where visas are not required may be asked to produce supporting documents upon entry. Even though producing supporting documents is no longer compulsory, travellers are strongly advised to carry the supporting documents. In the case of countries that endorse the particulars of parents in children’s passports, or other official identification documents, these documents shall be sufficient to establish the identity of the parents of the travelling minor.  South African children travelling abroad may be requested to produce supporting documents at ports of entry. Children with passports detailing parents’ names will not be required to carry birth certificates when travelling. In addition, a parental affidavit may be required. These requirements are meant to give effect to the Children’s Act, 2005 which stipulates that minors travelling in or out of the country must do so with the consent of both parents.  The Department has trained immigration officials to implement these changes. The amendments took effect on December 1, ahead of the festive season when many parents and families will be going on holiday with children.
