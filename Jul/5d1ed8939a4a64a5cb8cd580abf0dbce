Secret Sunrise is an urban event which people gather outdoors in the early morning to dance to soundtracks played through wireless headphones. From a distance it looks like a silent dance party with no music. It may look and sound awkward, but if you experience it with your headphones on you will actually have your feet moving. It is held once in a month and the location is always a secret. It is revealed only to those attending. They dance for an hour.   Anyone can join them in getting up and out of comfort zone, dancing, connecting and feeling complete freedom and self-expression.
Afterwards they enjoy coffee and juice. For this monthâ€™s occasion they danced at Mbombela Soccer ball.
