 MBOMBELA – With her long curls and bright smile, Diyana Omar could easily be mistaken for a teen mode,l but this head girl of Uplands College has other dreams. “I hope to study medicine next year and someday maybe specialise in paediatrics.” But for now, the biggest thing on her mind is the Upland matric dance on April 26. Lowvelder met up with her to ask her what her thoughts are on this year’s trends.

I also predict a lot of low-cut backs and high slits.” Diyana chose the material for her own dress two years ago and has been saving up ever since. “I contributed to my dress and paid for my own make-up trials. My parents were also very generous and I appreciate it a lot.” “You have to decide beforehand if you want to have your dress made or buy it. If you decide to make your dress you have to find a designer you are comfortable with and it is also good to try on dresses beforehand to see what suits you.” Other trends that she predicted were smoky eye make-up, strappy heels and statement earrings.
“An important thing to remember is not to worry about what people think, as long as you are happy.” Also read article on last year’s matric farewell: Curro matrics sent off on a steampunk evening
