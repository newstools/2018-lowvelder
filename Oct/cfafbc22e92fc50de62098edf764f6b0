 MBOMBELA – After a lot of controversy surrounding the Band-off at the Mpumalanga Show, it seems that the final chords have been strung. To put all the controversy to rest, one of the directors of the show, Karenza Ring, announced that the R20 000 prize money was donated to the Casterbridge Music Academy. “This is a good cause and we hope more children will learn about music,” Ring said. The original band-off was held at the show at Mbombela Stadium on August 30 and was followed by a dispute regarding the winners, the judges, the prize money, the legality of the contestants and the legitimacy of the whole competition.

However, the winning band, Solid Ground, did not want to partake. “To us, it is about the music, our passion and contributing positively to our community through music, more than winning or gaining prize money,” the band said. They denied the allegation that the participation of their guitarist, Freddy Loffler, was irregular. Ring said that they did give Loffler a fair chance to play again, but that he did not want to.
