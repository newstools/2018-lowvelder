 BARBERTON – The gruesome discovery of an infant’s body in the sewer over the weekend has prompted calls for girls and women who are facing a difficult choice to seek assistance and for the general public to help them wherever possible. This comes while police attempt to trace the mother of the baby whose body was found by community members at the sewer near Dindela Section in Emjindini shortly after lunchtime on Sunday. After alerting members of the SAPS about their find, Thulani Sibusiso said on Sunday that while this was not the first time that the bodies of newborns and foetuses had been found at the facility, it had not happened recently and there was little that could have prepared them for the discovery. “We found the body just before 14:00, but there is not really any way to pinpoint exactly where it came from,” they said at the scene on Sunday, while waiting for the body to be removed from the sewage drain.
“It has not really happened in a long time, but there have been similar cases where the body was flushed into the system and ended up here,” he said.

Sibusiso said they cannot really comment on where the child may have come from, as this is being investigated by the police. “However, we would like to urge the public to assist if they are aware of any cases where they suspect that unwanted pregnancies might have dire repercussions. We would also like to encourage those who might require counselling to get the help they need. The sewer is not for unwanted pregnancies, but we are asking that professionals, parents, councillors and the general public work together towards addressing this problem,” added Sibusiso The police had not responded to media enquiries at the time of going to press.
