MBOMBELA – Residents have reported to Lowvelder the increasing amount of garbage strewn on streets in the CBD and suburbs.
City of Mbombela Local Municipality (CMLM) spokesman, Joseph Ngala said they have people sweeping and cleaning the streets weekly, but that the public should be aware that the city is growing. “People must also be held accountable. How many times do you see a dustbin right there and someone has thrown their trash on the ground right next to it?” Litter on Enos Mabuza scattered next to a dustbin. He said people should take pride in the city and not litter. “It is everybody’s responsibility to keep our city and our planet clean. We all have a role to play for this.”
He added that anyone seen littering or dumping garbage illegally will be fined by CMLM.
Ngala urged residents to call the municipality on 013-759-9111 concerning anyone seen littering and also for uncollected refuse. People found dumping illegally can face a R2 000 fine.
