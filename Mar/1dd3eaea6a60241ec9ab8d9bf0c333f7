 SKUKUZA – With this in mind, SANParks would like to remind day visitors to Kruger that daily quotas will once again apply at the entrance gates. Visitors are urged to make pre-bookings prior to their arrival and there are three time slots which they can choose from: From March 29 to 31
• Time slot 1: 05:30-07:30
• Time slot 2: 07:30-09:30
• Time slot 3: 09:30 onwards. From April 1 onwards 
• Time slot 1: 06.00-08:00
• Time slot 2: 08:00-10:00
• Time slot 3: 10:00 onwards. “For busy periods such as the school holidays and long weekends, we aim to optimally manage the volumes that we expect, as well as our visitors’ expectations. The three different time slots are aimed at improving the spread of vehicles and, as far as possible preventing unnecessary waiting periods at gates,” said KNP GM for communications and marketing, William Mabasa.  The public will be able to book up to 80 per cent of day-visitor quota per gate via SANParks’ reservation offices and online at www.sanparks.org. Pre-booked day visitors will get preference at the gate over non-booked counterparts but must ensure that they arrive within their booked time slots. Arriving outside that slot, will be regarded as non-booked and therefore will not receive preference and could be turned away. These bookings can be changed as well through their reservation offices if need be. Mabasa also reminded visitors to read the permit which they receive at the gates because all the rules and regulations of the park are clearly stipulated on these documents. “Day visitors may not bring liquor as a result of the alcohol ban in public areas of the park. Further, visitors must please also refrain from committing other infringements such as littering, speeding and alighting from vehicles in places where this is prohibited in the reservation. These and other park rules are emphasised to ensure visitors have a safe and enjoyable experience, while not impacting other visitors, and hence must be adhered to at all times while in the park,” he advised. Visitors can report any infringement of rules and regulations which they witness, to the emergency call centre at 013-735-4064/0197 or 076-801-9679. It is, however, important that the following information is provided:
• Vehicle type and colour
• Vehicle registration
• Date and time of incident
• Yellow SATSA sticker number (for open safari vehicles)
• Details of incident
• Photographic evidence
• Location of incident. “We also advise guests to exercise caution when driving around areas undergoing major construction such as Skukuza Camp, so as to avoid unnecessary accidents,” concluded Mabasa.
