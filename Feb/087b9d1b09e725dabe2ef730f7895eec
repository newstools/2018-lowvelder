 MBOMBELA – The body of a 41 year-old woman who is presumed to have been strangled was found this morning.  The incident happened at a house on the Mabalel Road.  According to police spokesman Capt Dawie Pretorius, the woman had been working for a house sitting company and was looking after the house while the owners were away. “She was found in a ditch outside, there is a possibility she was strangled, but until the autopsy we cannot confirm this.” Hi-Tech Security Nelspruit Operations manager Nico Grobler said they received a call from the owner who could not reach her on the phone. ” We went through with the victims brother and we searched the house and could not find her. We found her outside in a ditch.” Pretorius said detectives and police’s forensic unit were on the scene. ” Nothing was stolen from the house.” Bossies Community Justice Albert Gryvenstein was also on the scene. ” This was not a farm attack although it is on a small holding outside town.” No suspects have been arrested and police are still investigating.
