 People from in and around the city went out in numbers to receive free medical assistance during the Mandela Day Eye Care Project at the Nelspruit taxi rank on Saturday. More than 500 people older than 40 received free eye-care services, spectacles, and underwent blood pressure and sugar diabetes tests.  Dr Abraham Varghese, the president of the SA Medical Association Lowveld, said this was their way of honouring the well-celebrated icon Nelson Mandela.

This initiative was organised by the Lions Club and South African Medical Association. The spectacles were donated by Plaza SUPERSPAR and Sanlam. The City of Mbombela Local Municipality contributed food and the South Africa National Council for the Blind assisted with registrations.  “We have been doing this for about eight years and our motto is to serve the community. This year we decided to attend to more people because of Mandela’s birthday,” he said.
Vaina Lukhele, one of the people who benefited from the initiative, said it is an incredible endeavour.

Ntombikayisa Manoka who came all the way from Matsulu said she admires the work that is being done by these various organisations. “They are making a huge difference in the community by helping us for free. I cannot afford to go get my eyes tested and they are doing it for free, and now I know what the problem is,” said Manoka.
