 MARLOTH PARK – In 2015 the Marloth Park Property Owners Association (MPPOA) helped to block prospecting rights applications from a different company. Denis Goffinet of MPPOA, Cindy Benson of Marloth Park Ratepayers Association (MPRA) and their colleagues have been working on finding out as much as they can about the application, company and prospective mining activities.Currently Manzolwandle Investments, situated in eMalahleni, is conducting consultations with interested and affected parties. The prospecting area comprises portions of Tenbosch 162 JU, Turfbult 593 JU and Tecklenburg’s Rach 548 JU. According to the comment form sent to interested and affected parties, this is subject to Regulation 17 of the Mine Health and Safety Act Tenbosch 162 JU borders the Crocodile River next to the Kruger National Park, Marloth Park, Lionspruit and Ngwenya Lodge. The mining rights being applied for are reportedly aimed at open-pit anthracite mining.

• Near protected areas such as Marloth Park and the Kruger National Park
• Noise, groundwater, surface water and air pollution
• Security risks
• Land use and rehabilitation
• Visual impact
• Migrant jobseekers. The possible serious negative impact on the fauna and flora, and as a result the loss of tourists heading to the area, is of great concern. If this happens, it will result in the loss of thousands of jobs in the area. MPPOA and the MPRA are urging residents and property owners to register as interested and affected parties and work together to help stop mining or prospecting before it gets off the ground.
