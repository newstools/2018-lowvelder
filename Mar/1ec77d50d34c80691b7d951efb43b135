 MBOMBELA – The annual event, aimed at celebrating, remembering, fighting back and bringing hope to cancer survivors, was held at Mbombela Stadium. Usually, it sees participants do laps throughout the night in support and solidarity with survivors. Unfortunately, this was not to be as the rain started bucketing down shortly after the survivors’ lap. This is the first part of the event and sees only cancer survivors, the event’s guests of honour, complete a lap together. Vusi Ngutshane and Sunday Mashabane. Chairman of the local RFL committee, Gerdi Terblanche, said as much as they were ready to start with the activities, nature had other plans. “As it continued pouring the field got wet. We know that it is expensive to fix the surface once it’s damaged. The rain was not really an issue for the people who came in large numbers, it was more of thinking about the surface. If it was a different surface, like concrete, we would have continued with our programme,” she said. Terblanche said the committee would soon meet to discuss future hostings and include a couple of other activities in RFL.
