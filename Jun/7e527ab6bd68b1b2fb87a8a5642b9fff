 According to a statement by Eskom there is a low probability of rotational loadshedding during the day as a result of power station units being returned to the system but the probability of rotational loadshedding increases for the evening peak period from 5pm to 9pm due to the normal expected increase in demand. Should rotational loadshedding be implemented today it would be for a period up to four hours. Eskom will advise if rotational loadshedding will be conducted in either stage 1, stage 2, stage 3 or stage 4, dependent on the capacity shortage. Stage 1 requires 1000MW to be rotationally loadshed nation-wide Stage 2 requires 2000 MW Stage 3 requires 3000 MW Stage 4 calls for up to 4000 MW to be rotationally loadshed nationally in that given period. Loadshedding is conducted as a measure of last resort to protect the power system from a total collapse or blackout.

These processes have now to be cleared out and restarted which would take additional time. These include: Eskom continues to encourage residents and businesses to please use electricity sparingly to ease the demand of electricity.

In the event that load shedding becomes necessary, Eskom and the municipalities will use the published rotational loadshedding schedules. For Eskom customers, these schedules are available on the Eskom website (loadshedding.eskom.co.za). Eskom customers can also contact Eskom customer contact centre at 0860 037 566.
