 BARBERTON – MTN handed over a R10 000 cheque to the Last Journalist Standing (LJS) competition winner, Nhlanhla Clement Mthembu from Barberton Community Radio. The 2018 MTN8 tournament provided a platform to recognise and reward journalist and media houses by pitching them against each other in a competitive football-related quiz. The quiz was online and journalists were ranked on a leader board until the one, ultimate LJS winner was determined based on aggregate. Mthembu emerged as the overall winning journalist. In addition to the title of LJS for 2018, Mthembu was also presented with a boarding pass allowing him to join the Last Fan Standing (LFS) winner, Lerato Mogatusi, on a trip to any football experience in the world.
