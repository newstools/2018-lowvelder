 As the fast approaching June exams affect thousands of South African learners, an expert advises a few ways to optimise limited study time without resorting to cramming with helpful study tips. Study groups for individual subjects to further the understanding beyond the books. Set up a WhatsApp challenge with your friends, where you can send each other questions about a subject. While it might not be fun finding out that your friend knows something that you don’t, this method helps you identify areas need work before it is too late.  It is very important to exercise during exams, to give your body and mind a break. If you share a study timetable with your friends, you can optimise your time by for instance, going for a run together during at which time you can talk about the upcoming papers and questions you believe are likely to arise. By having the same breaks it also acts as a conscience for each other to check that everyone is working when they should.  Studying in groups can boost your energy and keep you focused. One of the best ways to cement your preparation with limited time on hand, is to write past exam papers. “Get your friends together and hold a mock exam, imitating the exam conditions with set times and no peeking in textbooks. This approach has the dual benefit of making you more comfortable with exam conditions, while also solidifying your knowledge in a low-pressure environment.” ”Creative study methods such as the above will go a long way toward not only improving your performance, but also to cultivate a love of learning says Payne.
