 1. Plant a tree Get your friends together and have a tree planting day. Whether it is in your garden or at a local community ground, any tree planted makes a difference.  2. Read a book on trees A great way to kick off your Arbor Day is to read a tree identification book. Spending a day outside looking at your local trees and noticing new details is lovely way to grow your knowledge on the environment surrounding you. 3. Spearhead a clean up in your local park Get some friends and local residents together and head to a nearby park or forest to clean up the unwanted waste. Correctly disposing of waste helps maintain a healthy environment and improves the beauty of the area. 4. Hold an Arbor Day party Create awareness in your friend group by hosting a party to celebrate Arbor Day! Have fun with it and theme the party around local trees. Everyone can bring a little plant with them. 5. Organise a forest walk with your friends Pack a picnic full of fresh food and head into the outdoors for a day with your closest friends. A good place to start will be the Lowveld Botanical Gardens. Take in the beautiful area and have a relaxed day with good company in the fresh air. Happy Arbor Day!
