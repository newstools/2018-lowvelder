 SKUKUZA -The Kruger National Park (KNP) will hold even more appeal to Muslim guests now that the first of five prayer facilities have been opened. KNP managing executive Glenn Phillips and the Honorary Rangers of Johannesburg South, along with several Muslim guests inaugurated the facilities on Monday. The Joburg South branch of Honorary Rangers facilitated the project and managed to raise the funds required in a very short space of time. Visitors to Skukuza will find the facility on the pathway between the clock tower and Stevenson Hamilton Memorial Library. It includes a wash up (wudhu facility) for males, but guests will need to bring their own prayer mats (musallahs).

In line with international norms, as well as its vision of “connecting society”, South African National Parks (SANParks) is pleased to announce the opening of the first Muslim prayer facility at the Skukuza Rest Camp in the KNP. South Africa is among the top 10 tourism destinations for Muslim travellers, according to the Mastercard-CrescentRating Global Muslim Travel Index for 2018. The availability of prayer facilities and halal food are some of the top factors these guests consider when choosing a destination. During the opening, Phillips mentioned that there is a church in the park and invited other religious groups to contact him if they would like special prayer facilities built.
