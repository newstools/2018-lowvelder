 MBOMBELA – Faaiza Omar’s greatest dream in life is to have her own baking show on television and to write a recipe book. She is now one step closer to realising her dream. She is one of the final three contestants of the Lancewood Cake-off. The final will be aired on the Expresso Show on SABC3 on July 5. Zola Nene, Lorna Maseko and J’Something are the judges and will taste the cakes prepared by the three finalists and then cast their vote to crown the 2018 Lancewood Cake-off king or queen. Faaiza is the only remaining contestant from Mpumalanga. She originally entered two cakes into the competition but only one made it to the final. Baking is Omar’s greatest passion. “Around 19 years ago I started baking. I initially baked cakes for family birthdays, then I started experimenting with French pastries and since then I’ve been hooked on creating beautiful cakes.” READ ALSO: Local bakers strut their stuff in the Lancewood Cake Off
The cake that will be featured in the final is a rose, pistachio and raspberry gateau and Omar believes that it is her presentation and flavours that place her above the rest. Omar is a skincare therapist by day and she said she loves her career as much as baking, although baking is more of a passion. “I bake every day for pleasure. If I win this competition it would be the cherry on top.” READ ALSO: Lowveld ‘I Do’: Wedding cake ideas for him
