 MBOMBELA – One of the greatest concerns emergency response personnel have is they themselves becoming victims of the accidents to which they respond. For two Lifemed paramedics this fear became reality when they recently crashed their ambulance into a vehicle which cut across their way on the R40 near The Grove Shopping Centre. In light of the serious and unnecessary nature of these preventable incidents, the injured paramedics Metrie and Gertie Greyling have offered an insiders’ guide to how road users can ensure the safety of emergency response personnel responding to a scene.

According to him, the amount of focus required to navigate an emergency response vehicle through traffic means that the driver cannot take responsibility for the behaviour of other motorists and pedestrians on the road. “As soon as the lights and sirens are switched on we have to think about our safety, the safety of cars in front, behind and next to us while keeping in mind that cyclists, motorcyclists, pedestrians and animals might also be on the road,” he said.

This complicates our work as these motorists either don’t give way when we approach or at times jerk their cars to get out of the way without checking whether it’s safe to change lanes which could lead to them causing an accident.” According to Gertie, it is common practice for emergency vehicles to use the right hand or middle lanes to allow motorists to safely move over to the left hand lane. “We don’t like to zigzag between vehicles because this could lead to confusion and accidents,” she said.

She also recommended that the public avoid stopping at accident scenes. “We have in the past encountered scenes where a secondary accident occurs when people get out of their cars to come and look at the scene or take photographs and they then are hit by other vehicles moving past the scene.” “We have a saying which rings; dead heroes can’t save lives. Safety is very important to us,” she concluded. Lifemed offers the following tips to all road users:
• If you hear sirens don’t panic. Look around you to see from where it’s coming, if the emergency vehicle is behind you don’t slam on the brakes. Rather try to see whether it is safe to move to your left side so that the emergency response vehicle can pass on the right side. Remember to use your indicator lights.
• Always look to check how many emergency vehicles are responding to a scene so that you can ensure that you leave the necessary space for all the cars to pass safely.
• Don’t chase after ambulances or emergency response vehicles. Weaving through traffic or over red traffic lights is not acceptable and places all road users in the area in danger.
• At intersections don’t to take a chance by increasing your speed. Emergency vehicle drivers cannot predict at what speed you are travelling, by cutting in front of the ambulance or fire engine you put yourself and other road users at risk.
• If you drive past an accident don’t stop in the middle of the road or right next to the scene to have a look or to take pictures. By stopping in traffic you endanger yourself and everyone around you.
