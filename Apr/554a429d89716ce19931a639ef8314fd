 King Makhosetive Dlamini says the name change is a sign that the country is reasserting its own identity. Since the kingdom gained its independence from the British Colony in 1968 it has been known as Swaziland. Despite the positive response from revellers who attended the celebration, the country will consider registering its new name with international bodies such as the United Nations(UN) and the Commonwealth. Other changes may include internet domain, number plates, road signs at the country’s borders and postage stamps. King Mswati III ascended to the throne after the death of his father in 1986, becoming the youngest reigning monarch at the age of 18. He is known for his practice of polygamy and is currently left with 14 wives after Queen Senteni Masango died earlier this month. Although he is respected and fairly popular in Kingdom of eSwatini, his policies and lavish lifestyle have led to local protests and international criticism.
