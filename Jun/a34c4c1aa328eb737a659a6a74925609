 MBOMBELA – The recovery of his lost cellphone made Garth Snyman’s day a little brighter when it resurfaced at the We Fix store in i’langa Mall. According to Michael Kilner, branch manager of We Fix, the phone was brought in on Tuesday morning. “To my knowledge the guy who brought in the phone said that he picked it up and was trying to find out who it belongs to.” Snyman’s iPhone 8 got lost quite a while ago, on May 12. “It got lost at the air show. I believed it was stolen because when I phoned it, it was switched off and that is what normally happens. I wrote it off a long time ago,” Snyman said, adding that his phone was not insured.

Luckily, this was not the case. “We charged the phone completely and saw that it was blacklisted after which we phoned Vodacom,” Kilner said. The store phoned Snyman after confirming his ownership and he got the phone back on Tuesday afternoon. Snyman made contact with the man who brought the phone to the store. “He said that he had an operation and that finding the owner of the phone was not his priority, which I understand completely,” Snyman said. “I am just really happy to have my phone back.” READ ALSO: Protect yourself against identity theft
