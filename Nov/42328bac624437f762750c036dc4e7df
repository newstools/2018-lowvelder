No amount of rain could dampen spirits as the children splashed in puddles, enjoying the chance to don gumboots and umbrellas for a change.  The day was made possible by the teachers of the school. The children had the opportunity to enjoy games such as times table hide and seek and measuring distances with their feet, and then comparing it to the reading on the trundle wheel.  It was a fun-filled day, which the learners are sure to remember for years to come.  ALSO READ: Penryn Pre-School play teaches that beauty is not skin deep
