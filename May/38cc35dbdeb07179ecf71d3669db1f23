 Lowveld High School’s 2018 matric farewell was held on April 25 at Nutting House in Alkmaar, and while it may have been somewhat earlier in the year than usual, the evening was definitely an event to be remembered. The theme for this nostalgic evening was Winter Wonderland, and the venue was breathtakingly lovely. An ice-blue glow enveloped the room, while snowmen peeped out from behind frothy white curtains and the illusion of snow covered the floor. The matriculants arrived in style as well as fashionably late, sweeping gowns and beautifully coiffed hair on the girls and dapper, smart attire for the boys. The food was delicious, and a highlight was the sweets buffet: a long table decked in just about every sweet imaginable, from snake jellies to lollipops to marvellous cupcakes which nestled together invitingly on a tiered stand, tempting passers-by to sneak a bite.

The sound and lighting perfectly fit the occasions and it was certainly a night that the 2018 Lowveld High matric year would not forget in a hurry. Organiser Chantelle Janse van Rensburg is quick to thank the teachers, the Wyngaards, AVS and Ian Leach for all their help on the night, saying that in the end, it’s worth all the stress and panic of making sure that everything is perfect.
Nutting House was the ideal venue for the event, with sweeping views and a starlit sky to top everything off with just the right note, sending these matriculants out into the world in style. PICTURES:
