 The New World Wealth has released its 2018 Car Maintenance Index, putting the spotlight on the most reliable cars in South Africa. Opel is the only German brand in the top 5, with the balance being Japanese. The advisory group said it considered over 30 car brands for this study. “We included all major car brands available in SA,” it said, using the following criteria: Availability and affordability of spare parts for vehicle; affordability of services after motor plan has ended; reliability of car after motor plan has ended (with a special focus on number of major engine and gearbox problems that vehicle experiences over time); ability of dealerships to handle large repair jobs and affordability of such repairs and affordability of insurance premiums, relative to price of vehicle. The study was conducted through interviews with independent second-hand car dealers, independent auto mechanics and roadworthy vehicle inspection providers. The New World Wealth specialises in ratings, surveys, country reports and wealth statistics and, as part of this study, also rated the top car insurers for 2018. And the consumers agree.
