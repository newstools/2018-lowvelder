 According to AfriForum’s records, 33 farm murders could be verified since the start of the year.

A pillow was used as a silencer before both Gabriel and Marian were shot in the head.   “The widely spread allegation, that farm murders are currently at its lowest point ever, is plain false. To be honest, the verified data shows that farm murders have been increasing since 2011. Although less farm murders were committed in the first six months of 2018 than in the first six months of 2017, there is a grave concern about the sharp increase in farm attacks.
