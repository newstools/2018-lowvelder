 SKUKUZA – Branson Seiler recently photographed these two wild dogs about seven kilometres from Orpen Gate in the Kruger National Park. He recalls the sighting as a prelude to an unforgettable experience. His family was driving back to Orpen Camp, when in the distance they saw something on the road that appeared to be warthogs. As they approached, however, they realised that it was a pack of 10 wild dogs. They watched them for a few seconds and took pictures, before the dogs took off at speed. Branson took this picture while the family drove along them. When the pack spotted a herd of impala they divided, which is typical of pack hunting, with four going right, three left, and the remaining three straight forward. As they chased the herd deep into the bush, Seiler’s family decided to take a ring road around, hoping to catch a kill. On that road they were met by about 20 cars, watching three lions which the family had previously seen, so they
rushed past. As they moved up towards the wild dogs, the lions became aware that the wild dogs had taken down an impala about 200 metres from where they were lying. They charged towards the kill, but because wild dogs are incredibly fast eaters, by the time the lions got there, the impala had already been torn to shreds and devoured. The lions chased after the dogs for about 50 metres before giving up. The wild dogs just barked at the lions for a few minutes, then walked off.
