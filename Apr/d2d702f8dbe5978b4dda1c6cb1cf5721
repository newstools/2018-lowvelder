 MBOMBELA – A woman was left with a broken back and pelvis after an accident on Wednesday morning. She was later identified as Melanie Kruger. She was on her way to work at Simplify Vehicle Rentals on the corner of the R40 and Emnotweni Avenue.  According to eyewitnesses, the driver of a bakkie had skipped a red traffic light. He was driving towards Mbombela on Madiba Drive.  He hit Melanie’s car and it flew to the side of the road where it landed on its side. This left Melanie trapped in her car.  Both vehicles stood on the corner of Madiba Drive and Mystic River Crescent. This disrupted traffic on Madiba Drive, especially for motorists driving on the R40 from White River.  She was transported to Mediclinic Nelspruit where she was treated for her injuries. Robyn Baard, Mediclinic spokesman, said she did not have to be operated on, but she had been admitted. Shorty Kruger, Melanie’s father, confirmed on Facebook that she was still in hospital. “Her pelvis is broken in four places as well as her back. They will never do anything to that guy [who drove the bakkie] and that is why people keep driving like that.”  Melanie’s mother, Louise, also took to Facebook and said they were happy that their child is alive although she is still in a lot of pain. Joseph Mabuza, community safety, security and liaison spokesman, said no case had been opened against the driver and that an accident report was filed.
