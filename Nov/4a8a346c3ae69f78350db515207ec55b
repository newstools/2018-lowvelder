MBOMBELA – Lowvelder was at the scene and saw workers from Silulumanzi Sembcorp blockading the area. Water was seen running down into Piet Retief Street to the robots adjoining the R40. Some restaurants like Cicada were left without water.  SPAR at Sonpark confirmed they still had running water as it had affected the restaurants and shops in Faurie Street.  Silulumanzi Sembcorp spokesman Richmond Jele said the pipe which had burst had extreme pressure as the pipe went from the treatment plant to the reservoir in Nel Street. “They should be finished fixing the problem in about four to five hours at the most.”
