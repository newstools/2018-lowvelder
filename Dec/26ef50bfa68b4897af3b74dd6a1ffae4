 BARBERTON – Women in a stokvel from New Consort Mine were robbed of over R200 000 on Monday by three knife-toting suspects. According to Khanyezile Mkhonza, a stokvel member, the money was supposed to be shared on the day. While they were busy counting the money inside a house, three men allegedly arrived at the scene and produced a knife. She said the suspects reportedly stabbed one of the women before stealing the money. “We screamed for help and community members came to assist in chasing after the suspects. The suspects fled to the nearby mountain,” said Mkhonza. Patrick Sicelo of #Gijima Tsotsi, a community organisation fighting crime in Barberton, said when they arrived they joined the search for the suspects.

The rest of the money has not been discovered,” said Sicelo Capt Jabu Ndubane, police spokesman, said a case of theft has been opened.
She advised stokvel members not to make huge cash withdrawals nor keep large amounts of cash in their homes. “We would like to remind stokvel participants that huge cash withdrawals should not be an option when savings have to be shared. “They must rather request the bank to transfer money into each individual’s bank account, as agreed by all the stokvel participants. This time of the year, members of stokvels are deliberately targeted,” she said.
