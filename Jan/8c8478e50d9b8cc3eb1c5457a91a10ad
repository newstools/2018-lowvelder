 MBOMBELA – Residents of Sonheuwel suffered two consecutive nights of power interruptions last week due to an overload of the municipal power grid. According to electrician Pieter Janse van Rensburg, overloading is a common issue, which causes the amount of volts available on the grid to either dip or rise above the standard 220 volts. “It happens from time to time. The real danger is that due to the change in current, household appliances are at risk of being damaged.

At the time of the incidents it was reported that the City of Mbombela Local Municipality (CMLM) was investigating the matter, but that no specific faults had been found on the line.

He urged residents to report all cases of electricity outage to the CMLM so that the matter may be resolved as soon as possible. “Consumers must always report issues, as and when they arise, to 013-753-3331,” Ngala said.
