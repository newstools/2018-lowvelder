 MBOMBELA – Sanral is concerned about reports of crashes at the two roundabouts on the R37 and is urgently assessing possible measures to improve the situation. Classified as the P166, it was originally constructed by the DPWRT to accommodate the increased traffic flow anticipated during the 2010 Fifa Soccer World Cup. This section was later declared a national road by Sanral and so falls under its jurisdiction.

Sanral further communicated that despite the erection of lighting masts, no lighting has been installed due to a lack of electricity. “The CMLM has indicated that power will not be provided in the short term due to financial constraints. As a result, Sanral will investigate alternative interim arrangement for power supply and lighting.” According to Sanral, measures to curb the continued accidents will include upgrades to the curbing and a full review of the early warning road signs and markings.

The municipality’s spokesman, Joseph Ngala, could not be reached for comment. The public or any other concerned party is welcome to refer any further concerns or comments to Sanral’s project manager, Madoda Mthembu on 083-383-7320 or at mthembum@nra.co.za.
