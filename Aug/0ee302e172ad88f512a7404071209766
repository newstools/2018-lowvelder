 The ANC Mpumalanga said they will investigate Faith Harvest Bible leader, Bishop Max Lazarus Hangwi Maumela, for alleging that the deputy president, David Mabuza, is a murderer and that his girlfriend is premier. This was declared by ANC spokesman Sasekani Manzini during a press conference held on Monday at “Che” Masilela House. Maumela claimed that Premier Refilwe Mtshweni is Mabuza’s girlfriend.   He was addressing ANC members during a campaign for ANC chairman candidate, David Dube, in eMbalenhle near Secunda over the weekend.

He labelled us of using our bodies to get positions. He is undermining women. The role of the bishop is to pray, to ensure that the ANC can continue to lead, revolutionise our people and to better the party. I do not know if he forgot his role, which is to pray and work with the ANC. Having a female premier was supposed to be celebrated, especially by bishops since this shows that their prayers have been answered,” she said. Welcome Nkuna, Ward 3 chairman in Mbombela, opened a case against Maumela, claiming he defamed Mabuza.
