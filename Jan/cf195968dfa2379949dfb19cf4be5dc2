WHITE RIVER – Although a few parents had to hide a tear or two on Wednesday morning, the new grade ones at Uplands Preparatory School could not contain their excitement about the adventure that was awaiting them. The school welcomed two classes of  23 pupils each for their first “big school” year. With the school celebrating 90 years of existence later this year, many of the newcomers follow in the footsteps of parents and other family members by attending Uplands Prep.
