 MBOMBELA – Parents, teachers and pupils came in their numbers to learn more about the latest social media trends and the dos and don’ts of using social media. She covered a wide range of issues such as sexting, cyberbullying, hate speech and revenge porn, which, according to Sadleir, are the most common cases she deals with among the youth.  “The smartphone camera, screenshot feature and Internet connection are main risks linked to giving young children mobile devices. For other reasons such as security, parents should buy their children a ‘dumb phone’ just to make and receive calls. Underage sexting has become the norm,” said Sadleir.
She said everybody has become a celebrity in the digital age, even children, and parents should start managing that online reputation from a young age. “As a parent, you shouldn’t allow people to take pictures of your kids doing things that they wouldn’t want other people to see. Before posting online, teens must consider the reactions of their parents, principal, paedophiles, police, phishers and prospective employers. What you post online might affect you in future; most employers look at a potential employee’s Facebook account before hiring them,” she said.  Sadleir said the phenomenon of the screen grab or screenshot has made all online content potentially publishable and permanent. The executive head of the school, Mike Bownes, said the decision to have Sadleir address the school and community was to highlight that sense of responsibility before posting online. “It was vital for us to invite her. We decided to do this as a community service to allow everyone to come and learn something. I’m sure everyone who was here learned about liabilities and the usage of social media,” said Bownes.
