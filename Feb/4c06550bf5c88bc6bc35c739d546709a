 HAZYVIEW – Their own custom-made coffee station that can be rolled up and down the queue of cars at peak times at Phabeni Gate. That was something Patrick Khoza (58) and George Matukane (70) could hardly dream of, but on Monday they received just that. Followers of the Facebook groups pledged to help and a PayPal account for contributions was created. According to Lize Bester, the driving force behind the campaign, the few thousand rand received was spent on materials to re-erect their humble stall and accommodation.

She offered to sponsor a portable stand with an umbrella and other utensils. On Monday Gover drove all the way from Gauteng to deliver the new coffee-on-wheels station to Khoza and Matukane.

With it, a bright blue branded umbrella and sturdy wooden cases to store the coffee, tea and packets of sugar, were also delivered. Gover said, as a successful entrepreneur, she loves to help others. “I am always looking for small start-up entrepreneurs with enthusiasm to assist,” she confessed. They still hope to upgrade the coffee hut itself with the little available money. “We need treated poles and laths, corrugated-iron sheets and shade cloth,” she said. “The roof currently consists of plastic sheeting and laths and leaks like a sieve when it rains.” Also read: Mabuza: ‘People of Mpumalanga are ready to serve our country’ A dilapidated gazebo donated after the storm also could not withstand a subsequent windstorm.
