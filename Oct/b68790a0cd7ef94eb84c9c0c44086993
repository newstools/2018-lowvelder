 BARBERTON – Production at Sheba Mine, which is one of the Barberton Mines consortium, has been affected today (Wednesday). This is after residents from Matsulu blockaded the road leading to the mine this morning with burning tyres. Busses ferrying workers to report for a morning shaft were turned away. The residents are demanding jobs at the mine. According to Andile Mabaso, community leader, they are forced to pay bribes to some mine officials to be able to be employed. “There are some of our community members who testified that they paid up to R5 000 to a senior official at the mine, but to date they have not been employed. There are also allegations that some people from the Nkomazi area and Swaziland pay bribes of cows to the officials to be able to be employed,” said Mabaso.

Sello Mashabela, Barberton Mines’ human resource manager, said the criminality of the protesters affected production at Sheba. “Our workers were forced to report late for duty. For anyone to get involved in such a protest is a criminal act. As Barberton Mines management, we will not respond to criminals. The only legal way we will respond to the community is through their councillor, Donald Nkosi, regarding the letter of their grievances that they submitted to us,” said Mashabela.
