 MBOMBELA – Bateleur Estate’s management thanked its residents at an intimate gathering last Friday for participating in its festival of lights. The festival took place during December and saw residents transform their homes with decorations and lights. The public could visit the estate at a cost of R10 per car. All proceeds raised went to Huis Betlehem. Bateleur welcomed 1 300 vehicles, raising just over R25 000 for the children’s home. Residents Sarie and Jurie van den Heever transformed their home into a wonderland, where the children received gifts in the spirit of Christmas.  Their son, Pieter, joined in on the fun and made the experience more festive by dressing up as Father Christmas. “It was so welcoming that some people thought it was a restaurant and sat down to order,” said Sarie.  Their efforts paid off, as they were awarded best-decorated house. They received a R5 000 voucher from BUCO Nelspruit to accessorise their home. The Van den Heevers chose to pay it forward and gave the voucher to the children’s home. “The donation will enable us to cover one month’s expenses at the home,” said Jorina Schutte from Huis Betlehem. They also welcomed the BUCO voucher, which they will use for necessary home repairs.  Lourier Street in the estate was awarded a street braai courtesy of Crossing SUPERSPAR for being the best-decorated road.
Bateleur’s Magdel Terblanche promises that the festival will be bigger this year.  “Last year not everyone understood how it would work, but this time around they do, and we hope that it will be an annual event,” she added.
