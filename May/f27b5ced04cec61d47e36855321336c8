 MBOMBELA – According to Hi-Tech Security manager Callum MacPherson, their new AxxonSoft intelligent cameras situated at Westend Shopping Centre picked up a vehicle linked to a number of remote jamming theft cases at shopping centres around town. “We picked up a beige Renault and its registration number after watching footage of a recent case that occurred at the centre. With this information, we organised an operation with Nelspruit Concerned Citizens to keep a lookout for it.” On Sunday night, the vehicle was spotted by Hi-Tech Security White River’s Hennie Potgieter and Lappies Labuschagne. “They gave chase after it on the R40. The vehicle crashed into the side of the road and the driver got out and fled the scene.” The vehicle was searched and various items suspected to be stolen were found in the boot. We are expecting an arrest soon,” added MacPherson. Their new cameras also picked up five suspects at BUCO Nelspruit attempting to manipulate the electric fence. “The camera picked them up immediately. We could see they brought a ladder with them.” Within seconds Hi-Tech Security Nelspruit’s armed response unit was notified. “When our armed response unit arrived and surprised them, they dropped everything and ran across the railway lines.” That same night in Barberton, a suspect was spotted loitering at the fence of a local abattoir. “We sent out our vehicles and he was picked up and removed from the site. The camera picks up if anyone loiters near the area for too long.” In Acornhoek on Monday night at a business, three suspects were spotted on the system attempting to break in through the roof. “Police immediately responded to the scene, surprised the suspects and they fled before they could get into the building.” For more information about their new camera system, read more here : Hi-Tech’s new eye in the sky will help to curb crime
