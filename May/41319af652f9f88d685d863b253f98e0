Drawing on user-feedback, and incorporating the latest technology, Private Property has completely redesigned and rebuilt the app to create a simple, engaging native-app experience for smartphone users. The end result is a solution that makes property search simpler, faster and a whole lot smarter. App users are able to use the slick, intuitive interface to easily search thousands of properties for sale and to rent across South Africa. The app’s flagship feature, however, eliminates the need to search manually. Using a social-media-like feed, the app notifies users of new properties in real time. Users just need to follow the suburbs that they are interested in and they will start receiving push notifications as soon as matching properties become available. The feed ensures that time-pressed property shoppers don’t miss out on new properties if they are unable to visit the website. It’s property search, without the search! App users are able to fine-tune their property feed by using the handy filters on the app. Users can filter their results by criteria like price, property type or pet friendly to customise their search so that they only get the most relevant property listings sent to them. With the rich detail available on the app, users can get an excellent idea of what the property is like without physically visiting it. They can see detailed property descriptions, view high-resolution photos and even experience a high-definition video walk-through of the property. If they are interested in any of the properties, they can contact the estate agent directly through the app to arrange a viewing. If a second opinion is required, users are able to easily share properties with family and friends via WhatsApp, social media or email.
