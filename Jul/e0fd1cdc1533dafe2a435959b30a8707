 MBOMBELA – The closing date for the registration of pupils for public schools for 2019 is July 31. According to the Mpumlanga Department of Education, the district directors must submit their progress reports to the head of department on August 12. A final report on the admission of learners must be submitted by district directors to the head of department on August 31, after which parents will find out if their children have been accepted. Only the head of department can declare a school full, taking into account the size of the school, the availability of classrooms, the need to promote social integration and availability of space in the neighbouring schools.

The department, however, says that they want to make this process as easy and comfortable as possible for both the schools and the learners. “Principals are required to manage this process in their respective institutions and to compile reports to update the line function on progress in accordance to the admission policy of learners in public schools and the school’s admission policy,” said department spokesman, Jasper Zwane. “Principals of the schools must ensure that no child is denied admission to a school on the basis that his or her parents are unable to pay or have not paid school fees,” Zwane said. Most primary and high schools have registration forms available on their websites and at the school.
