 At times, first-year students might find it hard to cope when starting at their tertiary institutions. This is why you have to think very carefully before you choose where you want to go. It is important to remember that a degree from a university is not for everyone. According to EduConnect, only a third of students who enrolled at South African universities this year will graduate by the end of 2020. The most important questions you have to ask yourself when choosing a tertiary is:
• What do I want to study?
• Is this the best place to study in that specific field?
• Will I be comfortable in the milieu of this tertiary institution?

According to the magazine, Times Higher Education, you need to take a proactive approach to your learning. “Keep track of your deadlines, don’t start that paper at 03:00 the day it is due, do attend classes and tutorials regularly, and take a proactive role in your education.” Balance is also very important though. Your tertiary institution is not just an opportunity for learning, but also to socialise and learn new social skills. It also provides a student with the opportunity to broaden is or her horizons by taking part in a wide variety of extracurricular activities. During all of this you should never be afraid to ask for help. You cannot expect to know how everything works in your first year of studies.

The bottom line is that you can’t do something well if you’re half asleep, feeling lethargic or working on an empty stomach,” states Times Higher Education.
