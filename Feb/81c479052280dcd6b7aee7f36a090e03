 MBOMBELA – Saturday afternoon saw many folks trekking to Hoërskool Bergvlam. There they partook of delicious goodies, snacks and drinks, and browsed among stalls groaning under the weight of all sorts of needful and gimmicky things. Others lined up, eager to watch the seven’s rugby being played on the field as part of the annual Maroela Makiti Bazaar. Beautiful crystal pendants were on display, the proprietor quick to explain the intricacies of his wares. Also read: Maroela Makiti does it again Anel le Roux and Katelee MaCaskill. There were trays of beautiful silver rings and earrings, and clothing galore with the ubiquitous tight pants, skirts and dresses made famous by the “windpomp” design well in evidence. A large array of add-ons to complement them, such as metallic crochet tops, a few lacy items and pretty summer fare were also beautifully presented.

The children as always made the best of the hot day, and as the sunshine beat down they splashed about on the jumping castle-come-water slide with gusto. Much laughter and shrieking in delight could be heard as they slid along and landed with a resounding splash in the small pool at the end, filled with soapy suds. Everyone’s favourite food truck, Picasso’s, was on hand with its famous and much-loved margherita pizzas, and of course bowls of their trademark Mexican nosh. Fresh produce was also on offer.

An added extra to really liven up the day was the fabulous boereorkes, singing the likes of Creedence Clearwater Revival and similar-style old-school rock, along with the odd traditional music, foot-stomping and hip-swaying stuff to kick off the new year with a bang.
