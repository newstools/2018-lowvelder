 BARBERTON – A man had to be airlifted to Rob Ferreira Hospital after the truck he drove, overturned near the R40/R38 intersection.  The driver sustained severe back and abdominal injuries, but was in a stable condition when transported to hospital.  A source told Lowvelder that although the cause of the accident is unknown, it seems as if he lost control over the vehicle before it overturned. He was the only occupant of the truck, which carried a back actor.  The road momentarily had to be closed for Mpumalanga’s Emergency Medical Service’s (EMS) helicopter to land, but the road was soon reopened.
