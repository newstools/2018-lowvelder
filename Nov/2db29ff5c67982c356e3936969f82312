 According to the South African Reserve Bank, it is an offence to even be in possession of such notes and any person who is in possession of them knowingly is required to report this to the nearest police station or call 0860-010-111. The South African Reserve Bank urges people to make sure they have real money and to rather take their time to test the money they have been given than to end up with counterfeit notes. It encourages people to study their bank note features:  flick them and listen to the sound, hold them up to the light and check them properly. Not to be embarrassed by this, but rather encourage other people also to do so.  After all it is nothing personal, but in today’s day and age it is better to be safe than sorry. There are multiple ways to identify counterfeit notes to real ones. It is all explained by an image on the South African Reserve Bank website.
