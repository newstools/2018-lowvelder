We want to position South Africa as a leading country in Africa and educate the rest of the world on what is really happening here.” Mandla Lekhuleni and Preva Mbuyane. A concern that was raised by attendees was the fact that the indaba calendar was not yet up and running. This calendar is used by exhibitors to schedule meetings with clients countrywide, as well as overseas. “We assure you that the calendar will be up and running very soon, and that potential buyers will have to pay a fine this year if they do not attend scheduled meetings,” Sukha confirmed.
