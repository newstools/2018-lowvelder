 MBOMBELA – Wet weather has resulted in an increase in motor vehicle accidents since Thursday morning. TRAC reported 24 accidents on the N4 from 06:00 on Thursday to 20:00 on Sunday in the Lowveld. Its spokesman, Solange Soares Nicholson, said six people sustained serious injuries and two slight injuries. However, the Department of Community Safety, Security and Liaison only reported 19 accidents on roads in the province, with 10 people sustaining serious injuries and 17 minor injuries. ER24 paramedic, Kim Habib said they received 15 call-outs since Thursday morning. “Most were for fender benders and minor injuries.” She said that one driver had attempted to do a U-turn on Enos Mabuza Drive and another vehicle had driven into him on Friday. “We had just gone to a call-out at the same place for a vehicle that had veered off the edge of the road. The person sustained minor injuries.” On Thursday afternoon, a police vehicle hit the back of a truck on the N4 near the Ngwenya turn-off. The department’s MEC, Pat Ngomane, said motorists must be extremely cautious when using roads in wet weather. “This will assist in avoiding road disasters usually associated with this type of weather.” During last year’s Easter holidays 92 road accidents were recorded on Mpumalanga roads, leading to 30 deaths and 71 serious injuries. “Therefore the province is embarking on a programme to drastically reduce accidents which often leave scores of people dead and others with life-changing injuries,” Ngomane said. He called on law-enforcement officers to show no mercy to anyone breaking the law. He added that drunken drivers, speedsters, drivers of unroadworthy and overloaded vehicles and those without valid documentation would be taken off the road. During the holidays operations would focus on identified priority roads such as the N4, N12, R573 (Moloto Road), N17, N2, R38, N11 and R40.
