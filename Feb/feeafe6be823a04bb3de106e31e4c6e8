 MBOMBELA – The Department of Public Works, Roads and Transport (DPWRT) has thanked the group of farmers who banded together on February 1 to fix a section of road. Lowvelder reported last week how six farmers took the maintenance of about half a kilometre of the Rietvallei Road into their own hands. They transported in soil, scraped the road and fixed the storm-water sections, which they claimed were not properly maintained by authorities.

A representative for the latter, Archie Smuts, commended the community for standing together. READ MORE: 1 700 potholes on the D514 between Sabie and Hazyview
