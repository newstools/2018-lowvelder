 South African consumers will start queuing at the break of dawn and online shoppers will be glued to their computer screens as the annual shopping craze begins. 1. Wear a cross body bag Big crowds on a day where people are planning to drop a lot of money can definitely attract thieves and pickpockets, which is why it’s important to carry your money in your front pocket instead of in a wallet in your back pocket.  2. Set a budget Decide ahead of time what you plan to spend on the Black Friday sales and stick to it. You could quickly find yourself shopping for Christmas 2018, 19 and 20 if you are not careful. Be responsible and remember that the expensive festive season is coming up, so you’ll need a bit left over for this. 3. Check in advance if you can return your purchases Most outlets, both online and physical, will accept returns for Black Friday purchases, but this is not a guarantee. It is worth checking terms and conditions in advance to make sure that any purchases made ‘in the moment’ can be returned.  4. Have a plan of action Some of your purchases may be in the real world and some in cyberspace. A good plan is to start with cyberspace early and then head off to the physical shops once you’ve done the calm and peaceful online shopping. 5.  It’s important to dress appropriately on the day Comfortable shoes and gear are important so you can move around quickly. 6.
