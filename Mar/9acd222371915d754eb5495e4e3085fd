 MBOMBELA – A supporter of the EFF prevented two Lowvelder journalists from attending court proceedings. The Mbombela ANC ward councillor Kenneth Mkhonto is one of five people accused of public violence in Msholozi. He, Vusi Mamba (39), Mfundo Mlimi (28), Sipho Ngutshane (26) and Lucky Sithole (40) were remanded in custody after their arrest last week. They were expected to apply for bail today. However, a court security guard called the reporters, Hancu Louw and Arisa Janse van Rensburg, out of the packed courtroom B. In the hallway, he insisted that they identify themselves. A man wearing EFF-branded clothing was heard saying, “We don’t want you here. We won’t let you go in. These are my brothers and sisters.” Two additional policemen who attended the court proceedings, told Lowvelder they were there to keep the peace. One told the reporters that they were the ones disrupting proceedings. The reporters waited to see the presiding magistrate. After consultation it was agreed that they would not attempt to take photos in court. For this they had applied for written permission from her this morning. After the defence attorney consulted with his clients, he said he could not take responsibility for his clients’ supporters after proceedings. The magistrate was helpful, but suggested they don’t attend for their own safety and not to disrupt court proceedings. Interpreting the defence’s words as a threat, the journalists decided not to attend.  The journalists were told to return to court later to find out what happened with the court case. They intend to lay charges against those who intimidated them. Lowvelder is seeking comment from each of the implicated parties.
