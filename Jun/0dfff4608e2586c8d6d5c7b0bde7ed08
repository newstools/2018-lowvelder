 MBOMBELA – Johan Heunis (62) appeared in the Barberton Circuit of the High Court on Thursday for pre-sentencing procedures. In 2016 the local seat of the High Court found that Curgenven’s death, in 2013, was an accident. In September last year, the Supreme Court of Appeal ruled that Heunis had shot her on purpose. Today, the court heard closing arguments in aggravation and mitigation of Heunis’ sentencing from both the state and  defence. State advocate Johan Kotzé had placed on record that Michelle had in no way caused the gun to discharge a bullet. It is not clear how long she suffered from her wound before she died, but what was clear was that Heunis made no attempt to arrange medical assistance. Clinical psychologist Dr Etienne Viljoen previously testified that Heunis was clinically depressed. The defence argued that this should serve in favour of mitigation in that he had diminished capacity to distinguish between right and wrong and act accordingly at the time of the incident. It was also placed on record that he now suffers from diabetes. The state argued that the psychologist had only consulted with Heunis 18 months after the incident. Accordingly, Kotzé held that no proof existed of his capacity being diminished at the time of Michelle’s death.
The sentencing was postponed until tomorrow.
