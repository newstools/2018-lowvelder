I would not have been who I am, professionally and personally without my dear family, friends, patients and incredible colleagues and mentors. All of you share this award with me,” said Eksteen. She said it serves as an inspiration for  her to proceed with the good work of serving the Barberton community where  she grew up. “On a bigger scale, to also continue serving 1 200 independently owned community pharmacies across South Africa, about 2 500 pharmacists and 20 000 support staff employed by these pharmacies. As a director of The Independent Community Pharmacy Association (ICPA), it is in my heart to contribute to ensuring the viability of independent community pharmacies in South Africa and our neighbouring countries,” continued Eksteen.

All of this forms part of the 2030 vision of equal health care for all citizens in our country. Small and medium-sized enterprises, like the independently owned retail pharmacies, are extremely important to build a stronger, more stable economy. Such businesses often employ unskilled people, and up-skill them,” added Eksteeen.
