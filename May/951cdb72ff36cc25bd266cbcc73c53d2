 TONGA – The two victims, Elvis Nkuku and Anna Vilakazi, reportedly had several quarrels. This led to Vilakazi moving out of the house she rented from Nkuku in Nkanini, Block A and into a neighbouring house. Nkuku and his girlfriend reportedly also starting having problems, and they turned to the tribal authorities in an attempt to resolve them. Despite this, he suspected that Vilakazi encouraged her to go back to a former boyfriend and set fire to the former boyfriend’s house last Wednesday night. Luckily, community members noticed the blaze and it was quickly extinguished.  Nkuku then went to Vilakazi’s new home and set it on fire. Community members spotted the fire around 00:00 and tried to intervene, but it was burning fiercely. Vilakazi was burned beyond recognition and it was later discovered that the door handle had been securely tied to ensure that she could not escape. Nkuku fled to Magudu, but community members managed to track him down and beat him up. They took him back home and set him and his house on fire. The Tonga police were notified and the forensic pathology unit removed the body. A case of murder was opened at the station but no suspects have been arrested to date. Investigations are ongoing. The whereabouts of Nkuku’s girlfriend are still unknown. Vilakazi was buried on Saturday at the Phakama Cemetary, but Nkuku’s family are still busy with arrangements. They are reportedly waiting for relatives from Mozambique to join them.  The Tonga SAPS spokesman, Capt Magonseni Nkosi urged the community not to resort to mob justice. “The community must stop the tendency of taking the law into their hands. Because of their actions, the suspect cannot speak for himself and those who killed him will be charged with murder. What will happen if Nkuku’s family wants to take revenge against everyone involved in his murder? It will mean more bloodshed and violence,” he said.
