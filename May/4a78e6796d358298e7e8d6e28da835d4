 GRASKOP – Safety concerns over the alleged aggressive protest action by National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa members at the plantations, have caused the organisers of the York Forest 2 Falls MTB to cancel Saturday’s planned race. Event coordinator, Odette van Staden, said in a statement that entrants will be refunded their entry fees. Lowvelder understands that the strike started over the weekend and will bring readers an update as soon as more information becomes available.
