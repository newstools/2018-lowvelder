MBOMBELA – Joseph Mabuza passed on this afternoon after a collision occurred between a motorbike he was travelling on and a bakkie. The vehicle allegedly did a U-turn on the N4 towards Mozambique just before the Nkomazi toll gate, the DCSSL said in a statement on Saturday. Mabuza was travelling from a work assignment at the time of the crash and he was on his way to Mbombela. A case of culpuble homicide is being investigated. Mabuza has been with government for over a decade and he has previously worked as a journalist and a newspaper editor. The distraught Community Safety, Security and Liaison MEC Pat Ngomane sent condolences to Mabuza’s family, his colleagues and all his associates. He was with Mabuza at the Lebombo Port of entry hours before the accident where they were checking the developments on traffic flow as Christmas is a few days away. The MEC says what makes the pain of losing Mabuza even more profound is that  he was a true champion of road safety. Ngomane wished the family strength during this difficult time. Premier Refilwe Mtshweni described the news and Mabuza’s untimely death as a huge blow to the provincial government, as he was the champion of road safety in the province. “Let me pass my condolences to the family, friends and colleagues of Mabuza,” she said. Details regarding his memorial and funeral services will be communicated in due course
