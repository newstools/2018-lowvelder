 MBOMBELA – The fantastic production was on for four evenings, starting on Monday. Music Evolution is a production of song and dance portraying a timeline of milestones in the music industry, dating back from the 1950s to the present day. The production took the audience right way back into the 50s when rock and roll dominated the music scene. Most music lovers described those years as the Elvis Presley era. The production wowed the audience with their well-choreographed moves, and the Elvis Presley medley and the costumes were on point. The production was directed by Marietjie Viljoen, Nathan Robbers, Alza Voster and Irene Kraftt, who assembled the young cast consisting of over 80 talented high school and primary pupils.

An Afrikaans medley saw songs such as “Boy van die Suburbs”, “Kinders van die Wind” and “Skipskop”. Straight after that, it was time for African songs including “Jabulani”, “Patta Patta”, “The Click Song” and “Mama Thembu’s Wedding Song” to entertain the crowd.
