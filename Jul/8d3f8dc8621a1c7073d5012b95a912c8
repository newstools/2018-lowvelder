 MBOMBELA – A total of 53 walkers started their route from Johannesburg to Mbombela on Monday with two goals in mind: To keep themselves fit and to keep children out of trouble. These walkers are all part of the Lowveld Walkers, who have a meeting every single Saturday and have called their journey The Long Walk to Fitness. One of the members, Lindiwe Lubisi, a nurse at Mediclinic Nelspruit, explained how they plan to complete this route.

Each day they start where they stopped the previous day and a bus transports them back to their accommodation when the 34 kilometres are done. From Middelburg they will go to Waterval Boven and aim to complete the distance between Waterval Boven and Mbombela by July 11.Lilly Sifunda, also a nurse, along with Lubisi are responsible for the group’s first aid.  “We had a sprain on Wednesday, but luckily we were able to handle it,” Lubisi stated.For her this is a dream come true. “I never thought I would be able to do something like this. The support for us on the road is great, and when you feel like giving up it is the support that keeps you going.” Lubisi added that people honk and shout words of encouragement at them when they drive past.
