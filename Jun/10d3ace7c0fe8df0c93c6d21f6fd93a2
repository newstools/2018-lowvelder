 MBOMBELA – If you have been affected by Thursday’s Constitutional Court ruling on the illegality of firearms that have not been renewed on time, you are not alone. The judgement overturned a High Court decision in terms of which sections 24 and 28 of the Firearms Control Act were found unconstitutional. Section 24 deals with the renewal of firearm licences and stipulated that renewals must be done within 90 days. Section 28 states that firearms of which the licences were cancelled must be forfeited to the state within 60 days. Four days ago both sections were declared constitutional and legal.

One man from Tshwane was reportedly shown the door when he tried to hand in his weapon. Lowvelder would like to know whether locals have experienced similar problems, or whether the local police station is succesfully assisting gun owners in this process?

National police spokesman Brig Vishnu Naidoo has indicated that those who fail to hand in unlicensed weapons will face the force of the law. The SA Hunters and Game Conservation Association’s Fred Camphor urged law-abiding citizens to comply with the court order. “SA Hunters is still considering the full impact of the judgement and other options to resolve the matter. The highest court in the country has spoken. We will probably engage with the Minister and the authorities to discuss a pragmatic approach and to resolve the ongoing problems going forward,” he said.
