 ROCKY DRIFT – The planned sale of Bundu Lodge, an iconic spot of relaxation in the Lowveld, has taken a dramatic turn in court. Last year, a public announcement was made that the iconic lodge would be sold. The seller was Willem Janson and the prospective buyer was Ebundu (Pty) Ltd, represented by Ntombizodwa and Sibusiso Tshabalala. On September 22 Lowvelder reported that the parties envisioned a smooth transition. Yet they now find themselves at loggerheads. In December Lowvelder reported that the deal had fallen through. According to general manager Wayne Blake, this was due to non-compliance. The Tshabalalas disputed this and took the matter to court.
In an urgent application, they requested the court to order that the September agreement be signed and effected. They wanted an interdict preventing Blake from “knowingly causing harm to the interests of the applicant while occupying a position of trust in the applicant and the going concern”. On January 10 Judge Francis Legodi interdicted Blake. He also ruled that Janson may not sell Bundu to a third party while the litigation on whether the agreement is to be effected endures. The trial has been set down for March 5. • Apology: On December 12, 2017 in a report titled “Sale of well-known lodge falls through”, Lowvelder reported that Bundu Lodge will no longer be sold. A quote from Blake was added in which non-compliance was stated as the reason. The paper failed to approach the prospective purchasers – Ebundu (Pty) Ltd, represented by Ntombizodwa and Sibusiso Tshabalala – for comment.
The paper has since learned that the validity of the agreement between the parties was in dispute and is now the topic of pending litigation. Lowvelder apologises for any inconvenience caused.
