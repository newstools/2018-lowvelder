 SABIE – York Timbers has begun instituting disciplinary proceedings against members of the National Union of Metalworkers of SA (NUMSA), who have been disrupting the company’s operations and participating in unprotected strikes characterised by violence, intimidation and damage to property.

York Timbers respects the letter and spirit of South Africa’s labour laws and has had unionised labour across its facilities for many decades through the Chemical, Energy, Paper, Printing, Wood and Allied Workers Union (CEPPWAWU). York Timbers recently also agreed to grant limited organisational rights to NUMSA despite that union having no standing in the wood, paper and timber Bargaining Council. NUMSA has used this position to recruit aggressively for members, including waging a campaign of intimidation and bullying, which has severely disrupted York’s operations and resulted in at least four unprotected strikes in recent months. York Timbers remains committed to contributing positively to all stakeholders, including surrounding communities. Also read: Local takes reins at World Gold Panning Association

It is for this reason that York Timbers is taking disciplinary action against those individuals who have engaged in unprotected strikes and in unlawful conduct. The management team takes exception to NUMSA’s baseless, defamatory and divisive accusations of racism against our CEO. The actions taken by York Timbers with regard to NUMSA’s unprotected strike, have the full backing of the company’s executive and board. Sixolile Msayi, Country Manager at York Timbers said: “We have a proud history of harmonious and constructive relationships with employees, the community and organised labour. In this environment of difficult economic conditions, acting in accordance with the law, we need to protect the company and our employees from the consequences of NUMSA’s acrimonious approach and any violation of the Labour Relations Act.”
