 Bikers from all clubs and patches will get together to collect toys for underprivileged children. This year’s toy run kicks off with a pre-party at The Pub on November 17. Entrance for this event is R20 per person or a toy donation. The fun starts at 19:00 when Goat N Hare and Gibraltar will perform. The main event will be on November 24. Motorcycle riders from all over the Lowveld will meet one another at Rudamans Yamaha in Riverside at 10:00. According to TJ Maré, one of the committee members for the Lowveld Toy Run, this year’s event will be a full 30 kilometres long and riders from all across the Lowveld are invited.  Entrance is R50 per person or a donation of toys. Afterwards the fun starts at Honda/KTM Nelspruit with a variety of live entertainment, food stalls and biker games during the day. “You do not have to be a motorcycle rider to come and join in the fun of the after-party,” Maré said. This will start at 11:00 and continue until 22:00. At the after-party, a date for the distribution of the toys will also be announced. “We hope to distribute all the toys to local organisations who can use them,” Maré said. To donate a prize or for more information, phone Bernadette Woodford 082-308-2624 or Maré on 082-772-6396.
