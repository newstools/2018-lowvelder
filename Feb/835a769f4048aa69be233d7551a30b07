 KABOKWENI – DA leader Mmusi Maimane singled out these residents for his People’s Forum Tour last week, for being “one of the most affected communities in the province”. He met the community at the Bhuga Sports Ground last Friday, where they demanded that the municipality provide jobs, water, a tarred road and stop corruption in the area. “This place was hit hard,” Maimane said. “A councillor is accused of defrauding people, houses are not being delivered and there is a lack of employment. It is clear that the government has failed them.” Also read: Woman set to lead the DA in Mpumalanga for the first time Residents say the lack of water is a major concern. “The shortage of water affects me, because I need to take my ARVs on a daily basis,” said one woman. “I need to cook and I need water to do that. Our government is failing us and we want change in this area,” said another.

I have raised my concerns about the toilets they promised us but nothing happened. I also asked them to check my electricity connections. The charges are too high, and the little pension money I receive is not enough to pay,” he said. Maimane said he would investigate all the allegations and concerns raised. “The plan is to bring total change, not only cosmetics. The lack of water supply is an issue that will be investigated by the parliamentary portfolio committee. I will raise the issues surrounding youth unemployment in Parliament,”
he said. Also read: DA explains Eskom crisis
