 MBOMBELA – The app was designed and created for the organisation by Christiaan van der Merwe, Lowveld Hospital’s IT specialist. Van der Merwe explained that the app was not to compete with security companies. “It is free and easy to use for the community.” He said it was not an alarm system or panic button such as those many security companies have. ALSO READ: “Bossies is about information and support and this phone app will have contact information at your fingertips.” The app can be downloaded from Google Playstore. Search for BCJustice. Once downloaded, the first page shows the contact telephone numbers for BCJ’s Albert Gryvenstein and Danie Theron.  The contact information can be accessed without having data on your phone. Gryvenstein added that once a person contacts them via the app, a geographical location is sent to their phones. “This helps us if anyone is in need of assistance, especially on farms and plots. We can immediately get their location. We urge members of the community not to merely send their location, as this does not inform us about the nature of the emergency. “People register onto the app, so we immediately get their contact details and know who you are.” The app has a list of emergency numbers for police, the fire department and various emergency services. There is also a display of various doctors and specialists in the area. ALSO READ: The page also gives you the latest news in the area. “This is just to inform people if certain places are having protests for example or if major storms are expected, thereby helping them avoid any incidents.” Van der Merwe added that the app was a team effort in terms of design and development. “The project took about three to four months to develop. We will be adding more features onto the app.”
