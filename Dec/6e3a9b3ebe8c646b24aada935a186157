 The star rating of your holiday accommodation is a good indication of what you can expect – especially relating to the kind of kitchen you will be confronted with. Close your eyes for a second. What do you envision when you think about the self-catering accommodation you’ve booked for your December holiday? A luxurious kitchen that’s equipped with everything from a full range of stainless steel pots and pans, to a coffee perculator and even dishwasher? Or could it be a disappointing dark hole with a two-plate stove, malfunctioning kettle, blunt can opener and chipped plates? The star rating of your holiday accommodation can truly make or break your holiday.
