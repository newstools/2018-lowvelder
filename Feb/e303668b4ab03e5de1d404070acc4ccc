  KAAPMUIDEN – A 38-year-old man is expected to appear in the Barberton Magistrate’s Court tomorrow, after being caught in possession with two sets of rhino horns on Friday. According to a police statement, he was arrested during a routine stop-and-search procedure near Nkomazi Plaza. “Police saw that the man had a cooler box on his passenger seat, and discovered the horns upon investigation.” The provincial commissioner lauded the astute members for their alertness and versatility that led to the recovery of the horns. He mentioned that poaching of endangered and protected species is one of the problematic crimes in the province and is therefore a priority.
