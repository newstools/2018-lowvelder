WHITE RIVER – Neon Church outside White River burned down this evening. Eyewitnesses say they first noticed the flames on the roof shortly after 18:00. Soon the entire structure was ablaze. The building used to house Kokopelli and a number of other small businesses before the church opened there three years ago. It is believed that a man was trapped inside, but Mbombela’s acting fire chief, Petrus Mthiyane, could not confirm it at the time of publication. He said the fire has been contained, and firefighters continued to work to extinguish it.
