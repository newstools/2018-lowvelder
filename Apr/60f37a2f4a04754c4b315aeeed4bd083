The situation currently looks much better as a result of the recent rains and DWS calls for more restraint from the public in their water use. We need to always remind each other that we live in a water scarce country, therefore water use efficiency and water conservation must always be our priority. We are approaching the dry winter season so it is important that we continue using the available water wisely and sparingly for water security for all in our water scarce country. Let us always use water in a responsible way to ensure reliable access to this precious resource for the current and future generations. Water has no substitute so it is our responsibility to ensure that we do not run out of this important source of life. Also read: How the recent rain affected dam levels
