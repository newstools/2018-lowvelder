 MBOMEBELA –  The implementing agent, the Independent Development Trust (IDT), told Lowvelder that they are scheduled to reach practical completion in terms of the contractual scope of work on the set date. “Note that this is not the court opening date, but simply a contractual completion date,” IDT’s communication and marketing manager, Lesego Mashigo said. A total of R782,7 million has been spent on the project, R24,6 million more than the original budgeted amount of R758,1 million, according to answers obtained from the Department of Public Works, Roads and Transport.

not met. In March the IDT set the completion date as October 3, but in September it was moved to December 10. The newspaper previously reported that the initial delays were caused by contractual matters, which have since been resolved. The entrance and exit of the court have also been finalised and will be via Samora Machel Drive, where construction is currently ongoing.
