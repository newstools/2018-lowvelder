 Loadshedding is conducted as a measure of last resort to protect the power system from a total collapse or blackout. Residents and businesses are encouraged to use electricity sparingly to ease the demand of electricity. Switch off geysers during the day especially during peak periods (05:00 to 10:00 and 17:00 to 22:00) as well as all non-essential lighting and electricity appliances to assist in reducing demand.
