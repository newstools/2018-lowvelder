 MBOMBELA – The wheelchairs were a gift from a partnership between TRAC and Curro Nelspruit.Eric Ndashe, principal at KaMagugu Inclusive said they were extremely grateful for the amazing gifts they received. “They gave the gift of mobility to those who would normally have to crawl or be carried. This can be very degrading and that is why we want to thank all the parties involved for this generous donation.” “It all started with the Curro heart project. We knitted quilts to raise funds for those in need,” said Stephna Lubbe, the teacher in charge of the project at Curro. “We heard about the need here at KaMagugu and decided to take hands with TRAC to see how we could help.” “We were so happy to help with this amazing project and to see the smiles on the children’s faces,” said Kathleen Greeff, TRAC spokesman. TRAC also bought along its mascot, Sipho, who taught the children more about road safety.
