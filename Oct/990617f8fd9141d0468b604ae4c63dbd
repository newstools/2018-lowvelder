 MBOMBELA – The owner of the house contacted security and police after his dog dragged a fetus into his garden which it had found in the park. Hi-Tech Security Nelspruit officers discovered a bloodied packet near a dustbin which had been ripped open by a Dachshund. The Dachshund had then dragged the fetus along a pathway into its owner’s back garden, where it was discovered. A neighbour complained that the park had become a dangerous place. “We do not even walk through it to get to the shops anymore. Day or night.  There is always cars parked there and people publically drinking even during the week.” Police were currently at the scene awaiting the forensics unit.
