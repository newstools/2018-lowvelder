 Local artists Anne-Mari White and Zané Jansen van Rensburg recently performed a tribute show to the iconic band. The concert on October 24 was a fund-raiser in aid of CANSA. The A-Lounge is a brand-new venue focusing on those who prefer a smart-casual dress code and entertainment and catering that is top-class. It has not yet been officially opened but hosted the fund-raiser as part of a prelaunch.  Guests dressed to the nines for the occasion, looking famously smart and elegant. They were welcomed with trendy cocktails and delicacies from the bar and kitchen while Anne-Mari and Zané entertained the approximately 70 guests. “The A-Lounge has not been launched yet, we still have a few things to do before we will invite everyone for a formal opening,” said Jacques Lombard, who established the venue with Hugo and Nayana Morgado and Claud Kruger.  At the end of the evening the audience could only say, “Thank you for the music” and for the breath of fresh air that was a night out in style, elegance and authenticity.
