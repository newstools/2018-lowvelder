 “It was the best birthday present ever,” said Robert Lemmon, organiser of the second Annual Truck Run. From September 28 to 30, participants took to the roads for the Spring Run 2018. Eight American long nose trucks were part of this adventure.   Everyone gathered on Friday in Truckers celebrate arrival of spring Dullstroom and spent the evening at the Duck and Trout. On Saturday morning, after a roadside breakfast, they departed for White River via Lydenburg and Sabie. The highlight of the journey was undoubtedly stopping on top of Long Tom Pass and sounding the very loud air horns in unison, causing goosebumps for many.  After refreshments at Gum Treez, the convoy made their way through Mbombela to Kwanyoni Lodge, where Jacques and his team treated everyone to a Bushveld braai in the boma. Sunday morning saw the group having a hearty buffet breakfast followed by cake and champagne to celebrate. And of course, unfortunately, all good things must come to an end, and around lunch time everyone headed home happy after having a trucking good time
