 TONGA – Following the accident in which Lindokuhle Silinda recently died, Nkomati Anthracite Mine was temporarily closed pending an investigation. The probe was launched becasue Silinda drowned after driving an articulated dump truck into an open pit mine filled with run-off water. She was a non-employee who had illegally gained access to the site. Her death is currently under investigation by the Tonga SAPS, under Capt Magoseni Nkosi. The CEO of the mine, Allan Hepburn, said they used the closure to ensure that other potentially unsafe areas on the premises were secured and any risk of injury or fatality eliminated. These included a comprehensive audit and analysis of the reason for potential system failures as well as an action plan to prevent further recurrences of such failures. “The DMR has conducted an investigation into the matter and has granted the mine permission to resume operations as of last week,” Hepburn said.
