 MBOMBELA – Many people believe that tampons and pads are luxury items. Women all over the country are now arguing that in fact it is an absolute neccesity and should not be taxed by the South African government. According to Marie Claire magazine, many states in the United States and United Kingdom, as well as South Africa, still add tax to these items. However, the state New York has stopped adding tax to these items since April 2016.

Did you know that in South Africa it is estimated up to seven million girls miss around 60 days of school a year because of their menstrual cycle,” Marie Claire said. As activist organisation, Equal EducationEE senior researcher, Samuel Shapiro puts it: “These products are not a luxury item, they are an essential part of every women’s lives and every women’s dignity. Providing access to these products for all women and girls is simply non-negotiable.” It can thus be said that tampons and sanitary pads are not a luxury item, but a necessity that should not only be free from tax but free to all women.
