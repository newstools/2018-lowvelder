 MBOMBELA – Goat N Hare are gearing up for what will be the biggest show of their careers to date: BosRock, the-first-of-its-kind, old-school, hard rock concert. It takes place at Kwanyoni Lodge on October 6 where Goat N Hare will be joined on stage by fellow local rock outfit, Gibraltar, as well as Jonathan Peyper, The Black Cat Bones and the RIDERS. Mel Botes, Valiant Swart, Piet Botha, Robin Auld and the Akkedis brothers will all perform their own music, and your favourite rock classics from the 60s, 70s and 80s. Think Johnny Cash, The Doors, Bob Dylan, Pink Floyd, Jimi Hendrix, Chris Rea and The Rolling Stones. Goat N Hare’s approach is to basically have fun creating their own music, as well as paying homage to the greats in their own style. “It is nice to have an actual rock festival come to town and being able to participate in it,” Freddy Loffler said. “That is the music that we do.” The winner of the 2017 Vodacom Battle of the Bands Competition in Mpumalanga comprises Loffler and Sunny Alexander Principe on lead guitar, Mongesi Mork Chiloane on bass, Barry Odendaal on drums, Prince Anang Fio on trumpet and percussion, and Mize Negrao-Principe on vocals. At BosRock fans can expect some “badass, old-school, ballsy, dirty blues and hard rock,” Loffler says. BosRock is brought to you in a partnership between Lowvelder, Mahindra Nelspruit, Storm Produktionz, Panarottis i’langa, AVS Hire, Harley-Davidson Big Five, Moroccan Barber, Nkomazi Fuel, Food Fundi and Uniwisp.   On the day concertgoers can also park for free at i’langa Mall on the day to catch a ride with Citybug for R20 to the venue and back. Seating tickets start at R150 up to R300. R100 will get you through the door, but please bring your own seating. No own cooler boxes will be allowed inside the venue on the day. Tickets are available from Computicket, all Shoprite and Checkers outlets as well as at the gates on the day. See you at Kwanyoni Lodge on October 6.
