 MBOMBELA – According to Bossies Community Justice’s Albert Gryvenstein (BCJ), the wife of the victim came home to find her husband bleeding on their bed. “It seems there could have been two or three attackers.  It looks like the man was standing outside the kitchen door when he was first attacked.  So far we can determine that only his wallet is missing.” He said the children of the couple were possibly asleep in their rooms when the attack took place.

Gryvenstein confirmed that the man was taken to Mediclinic Nelspruit by Hi-Tech Medical Services.  Paramedics that treated the victim, said he was still conscious. “His whole side of his face has been damaged.
