 BARBERTON – The sale of Lily and Barbrook mines is official and will soon see them reopen. Mike McChesney, CEO of Vantage Goldfields Ltd, and Fred Arendse, CEO of SSC Flaming Silver, said in a joint statement that the only outstanding matter to finalise the sale was approval by the mineral resources minister, Gwede Mantashe, to consent to the transfer of the mining licenses. The SSC Group, through its subsidiary Flaming Silver, and Vantage Goldfields SA (VGSA) have signed an agreement for the sale of its 74 per cent shareholding in Vantage Goldfields. It includes its interest in Makonjwaan Imperial Mining Corporation which owns Lily and Barbrook mines. The mines have been placed in business rescue and operations halted after a shaft at Lily collapsed in February 2016. Lowvelder previously reported that SSC secured a loan of R190 million from the industrial development corporation and an additional R110 million from investors to obtain sufficient funding to reopen the two mines.
