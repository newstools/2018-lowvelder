 MBOMBELA – She is known as one of the most remarkable women in South African journalism, but for Ruda Landman it is a privilege to hear other people’s stories.  Landman will be the guest at Lowvelder’s Pen in my Hand event on June 30 at 11:00 where she will speak about her book Tell Me Your Story. For the first time the monthly event forms part of the Innibos National Arts Festival, which starts on June 27. The book not only includes interviews with South African icons, but also an interview Landman did with herself. “And if I had to do the same kind of interview with myself, following my path through life and looking at twists and turns, decisions and happenstance, what would that look like? It’s a question we could all ask ourselves, so let’s see…” She follows this by telling readers about her time on television, how she ended up being a teacher, her personal life with her husband and son and the great reputation she has managed to build for herself. This conversation promises to be riveting and to engage the audience with stories about the past as well as how they affected the future. • Landman will be interviewed at Caster-bridge by Lowvelder’s very own De Wet Potgieter. Tickets for the event cost only R52 per person and can be bought at Computicket. READ ALSO: Boek oor gaydebat onder loep geneem
