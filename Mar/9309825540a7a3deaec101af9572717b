 MBOMBELA – Church Unlimited’s monthly Café Evening, held after the late service last Sunday, was a lovely, laid-back, casual affair with a warm and inviting atmosphere conducive to a good start to a busy working week.
Despite the rain, the turnout was excellent, and if a little light music, supper and a delicious coffee is your thing, then this is the place to be.
Reon van Aardt, dietician by day, dusts off his microphone and plays beautiful and expertly delivered renditions of popular songs, with the help of Jacquie Brits, a vocalist with a soaring, richly balanced, warm-toned voice. Perfectly matched, this duo is simply spectacular together, and had many an audience member swaying in time to the music. Bowls of pasta kept the hunger at bay, with richly dark and delicious chocolate cake and coffee to wash it all down.
The Café Evening is an excellent way to socialise with other members of the congregation as well as the community at large, getting to know each other on a social level within a relaxed and pleasant environment and convivial atmosphere. People are friendly and open, with little groups laughing heartily and enjoying the company of fellow congregation members in an informal setting. There are children bouncing a ball, laughing in delight as it ricochets off someone’s chair, causing her to good-naturedly toss it back to them, teenagers taking a quick dip in the splash pool, despite – or perhaps because of – the soft, warm rain.
Old friends coming together and new friends being made are all reasons which come together to make for a welcoming and inviting Sunday night out after the evening worship before the week’s rush sets in.
