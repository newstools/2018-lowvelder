Children change from being dependent, helpless babies to walking, talking and exploring toddlers, and funny, clever, unique young children. It is an extraordinary privilege to see children grow, blossom and become wonderful…  Kiepie & Kandas Kleuters is a private day-care centre providing a safe, secure, healthy, fun and loving environment for children ages 3 months – 4 years old.  We apply Christian beliefs in our educational program and like to think a little “out of the box” in our approach to child care.  We believe in a holistic approach to prepare little people to meet the challenges of life as well as academics. It is important for them to learn about themselves, about healthy relations, social behaviour, emotional development and resilience. They must see the beauty and awe while the facilitators assist and boost them in realising and aiming towards their full potential.  Our small groups ensure that individual attention is given. Learning through play is a guaranteed successful method of growth.  In order for Kiepie & Kandas Kleuters to strive for perfect learning absorption of little brains and provide educational building blocks and stepping stones, we are hosting our first annual golf day on 30 November 2018.  Funds raised from this event will be used to improve the safe and fun learning environment for our children by purchasing gross motor soft play equipment.  We are also currently constructing additional classrooms and an undercover play area as we aim to constantly construct little minds and bodies. As the saying goes “The road to success is always under construction”.  For more information on Kiepie & Kandas Kleuters Nelspruit email info@kiepiekandas.co.za or call 062 744 0643.
