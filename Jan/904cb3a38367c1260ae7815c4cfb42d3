 LYDENBURG – The High Court of South Africa, functioning as the Mpumalanga Circuit Court in Mbombela, ordered that Eskom restores full supply of electricity to Thaba Chweu Local Municipality (TCLM) and may not terminate or interrupt it until January 31, 2018. This follows after the business chambers of Lydenburg, Graskop and Sabie failed in their first court attempt aiming to restore the power in the affected towns. The first application was unsuccessful as the judge ruled it not to be an “urgent matter”. The chambers then took the matter to the Constitutional Court. The latter referred the matter back to the High Court where the outcome was in favour of the application.  The court stated that this would be implemented with immediate effect unless otherwise agreed by the parties or ordered by this court. A surprising and welcomed order included that the 10th respondent, the premier of Mpumalanga, David Mabuza, must report to the court by January 26 on his considerations of non-payment by TCLM and his steps taken to normalise the relationship between the municipality and Eskom. In the event that the matter is not resolved by the parties by the end of January, the court ordered that this interim will lapse automatically and Eskom is authorised to proceed with the interruption of electricity to TCLM. This municipality owed Eskom about R400 million when power interruptions were implemented on October 28 last year.
