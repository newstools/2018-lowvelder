 The organizers will also run a fundraising event on September 1. Visitors to the show, or rather the young ones (pupils and students), will be offered an opportunity to do a couple of laps around the track for a small fee. What is the eV Challenge all about? Well, the initiative encourages high school learners to design and build a battery-driven car within set specifications. The team must then race this vehicle around a short track for an hour. The winner is determined by, among other things, the number of laps completed over the time of the race. The format for the night race is slightly different, and this presents teams with a somewhat different set of tasks to that of the day race.

It is not! Teams may not replace batteries during the race – it is one set and one set only – sealed and checked by the marshals. But it is fun. The learners who participate and have participated in the past, without exception will always tell you how they have benefited, both during the project and in their student and adult life. It teaches life skills and instils emotional intelligence which would otherwise not have been acquired. The organisers would welcome the participation of local business – both in terms of entering teams in a corporate challenge in 2019 as well supporting those schools that crave participation but lack support. Please contact Klasie on 083-310-7317 should you wish to support this initiative.
