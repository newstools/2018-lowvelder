 Those at Misty Mountain and some in the Badfontein Valley, are but a few of these wilderness trails recently made accessible by him.  As consultant for the Mpumalanga Tourism and Parks Agency (MTPA) Ruthven is currently also rehabilitating sections of famous escarpment routes like the Treur Valley and the Blyde that had been neglected in recent years.  This means great opportunities for hikers visiting the province in the future. Here are photographs from his collection as teasers of things to come.
