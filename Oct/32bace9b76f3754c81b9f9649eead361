Camz Engelbrecht started his Sunday off with this incredible sighting inside Idube Game Reserve. He captured a female leopard taking down an Inyala right in front of his eyes on Sunday morning. He published the video on Facebook with the following caption: “What a way to start the day. Holy crap. The Schotia female taking down a Nyala in Idube Game Reserve (with Brogan Parsons). Excuse the audio, was pumped with adrenaline.” Idube is situated in the Sabi Sand Private Game Reserve, adjoining the Kruger National Park in South Africa.
