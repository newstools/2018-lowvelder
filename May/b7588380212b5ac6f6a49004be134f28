MBOMBELA â€“ On June 16 teams can show off their potjie skills for the benefit of Pro Gratia Learning Centre. The competition, with amazing prizes up for grabs, will form part of a fun day for the whole family which will include loads of entertainment for children. As a way of giving back to the community it serves, Canary Walk Mall will donate all the funds raised to Pro Gratia, a school for pupils with special educational needs. Everyone is invited to join to make a difference while having fun.  Businesses are invited to enter teams. There is only enough space for 40 teams to enter. The entry fee is R500 per team and includes a voucher worth R200 from Shoprite for your ingredients, as well as a goodie bag. There are four categories: beef, lamb, chicken and venison.  The fun starts at 08:00. The potjiekos will be for sale too and all the funds will go to the school. For more information contact Karen on 013 754 1155 or info@fgkcap.co.za.
