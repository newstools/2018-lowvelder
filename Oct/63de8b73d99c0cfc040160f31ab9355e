 EMJINDINI TRUST –  Emjindini Royal Kraal was a hub of activity on Sunday when the Nkosi Royal family, with the Emjindini Traditional Council, hosted the annual ummemo traditional ceremony. The Royal Kraal came to life when the community and residents of surrounding areas came out in large numbers to listen, witness and celebrate the ummemo. Floorboards rattled on the stage as highly talented cultural groups took turns to entertain the royal families, dignitaries and community members who came to commemorate with the Nkosis and Emjindini Traditional Council. Speaking at the event, Chief Kenneth Nkosi said it was their role as traditional leaders to restore and preserve cultures. He said as traditional leaders, they are working hard to improve the lives of members of the public and have a united community. “I am pleased that the event is a platform that showcases our history. It is a display of a myriad of cultural values and norms, as we are expecting people from different cultural backgrounds. This traditional function is meant to encourage the African customs and traditions, despite the technology we might be exposed to nowadays. It also helps with the regeration of morals, as they are decaying in society,” said Nkosi. The Emjindini Traditional Council is one of the 60 recognised traditional councils in Mpumalanga. Cultural functions such as these are held annually to revitalise heritage and traditional legacies. These ceremonies play an integral part in restoring and preserving African culture. They also positively contribute towards economic development in the communities, both in the big and small sector.
