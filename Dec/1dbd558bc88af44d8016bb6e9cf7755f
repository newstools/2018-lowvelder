 MBOMBELA – Nelspruit police spokesman Capt Zandile Gqawa said in one incident, the suspect acted as a sales agent and lured a victim to trade in two vehicles (a Ford Ranger and a Ford Eco Sport) for a Toyota Fortuner.  “The paper work was done and the victim got the Fortuner but later she received a message from the bank informing her that she still owes the bank.” In another incident, the suspect sold one BOB CAT machine (construction machine) to three different people. On Wednesday, police arrested the suspect while he was meeting with two of his victims.  “He was charged with three cases of fraud and will appear before Nelspruit Magistrate’s court on Friday.” Police are still investigating other cases which include vehicle and insurance fraud and  envisage that more charges will be added. The Station Commander, Brigr Prince Ngobeni appreciated the arrest of this alleged fraudster and hopes for justice to be served in order to deter other future fraudsters. He requested the community to be vigilant when spending their hard earned money and to do proper research before making any transactions.
