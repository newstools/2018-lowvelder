 The Whities really have talent, but Faneri Chawane just proved that his was worth the title of winner in the school’s 2018 Whities Got Talent competition. With his rendition of “This is Me” he won the hearts of the three judges, including well-known Lowveld artist Natasha C, as well as those of the whole audience. This grade seven learner, dramatically clad to suit his outstanding voice, almost sang everybody into a trance to first win the grade seven category and eventually the competition. He also concluded the evening on a high note with his encore. Other winners from the different grades are: Gr 1 – Asanda Mphanga, with a dance item called “I Feel Better When I’m Dancing” Gr 2 – Jeanne Badenhorst with her drawing of Mandela Gr 3 – Karsten Meyer with a solo rendition of “A Million Dreams” Gr 4 – Iline Botha with a dance item “Lean On” Gr 5 – Marizaan Britz with a dance item “Footloose” Gr 6 – Jenilee Nieuwenhuyzen with a rendition of “Ave Maria”.
