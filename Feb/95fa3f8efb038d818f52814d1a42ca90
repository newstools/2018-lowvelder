 MBOMBELA â€“ A local firefighter died while fighting a raging fire in the mountains surrounding Franschoek yesterday.
Makelepe Sedric Seokoma (36), an assistant project manager who worked at Sekororo Base in Limpopo but resided in the Lowveld, was engulfed by flames in the Simonsberg Mountain near Klapmuts in the Western Cape. Manager of the Lowveld and Escarpment Fire Protection Association, who used to work with Seokoma for years, said he is saddened by the loss of a dedicated colleague and friend. The fire started on Saturday on the property of a forestry company and spread to the Simonsberg Mountains. Working on Fire (WoF) had 25 firefighters who provided fire-suppression support and the blaze was declared as contained on Sunday at around 18:00. Due to unfavourable weather conditions which were precipitated by a high fire-danger index (FDI) in the area yesterday, it rose again. WoF commemorates wetlands day The WoF Strand Team comprising 20 firefighters, including Seokoma, was called out again to assist in trying to bring the flare-up under control. Unfortunately, in this pursuing operation he lost his life and WoF dispatched a Huey helicopter and fixed-wing spotter plane that helped in the evacuation of the remaining firefighters from the Simonsberg Mountains.
