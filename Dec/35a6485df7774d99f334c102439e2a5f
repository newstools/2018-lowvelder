 MBOMBELA – Morongwa Dlamini has taken the title of Mrs Mpumalanga 2019.  Organised by Timeless Productions, this year’s amazing beauty pageant production was themed “The Greatest Showman”. Timeless’ Jacques Lombard opened the show on the red carpet himself with a dance routine fitting to the theme.  Dlamini was later named the most sassy, sensual and smart, taking over the crown from Mash Mokgatle.  Lombard said it was the best production to date. They chose the theme as this year marks the 10th anniversary of Timeless Productions. ALSO SEE: Mrs Africa finalist make a mark “It was the biggest and best yet. Performing took a lot of guts, but I am so glad that I did it,” he added. Zane Janse van Rensburg was the creative producer.  Seven artists from Mpumalanga, 24 Mpumalanga choir members, 14 dancers and two masters of ceremonies ensured it was one for the books.  Saturday drew an audience of 1 013. Ladz Timeless Couture dressed everyone, Lombard added.  Mrs Mpumalanga is not a beauty pageant. “We are looking for an ambassador for Mpumalanga and therefore interviews and presentations of business plans count 80 per cent,” he added. The finalists are also judged on reaching personal targets (among these is raising a minimum of R10 000) as well as a white dress category (sponsored by Bride&Co) and an evening dress of their own choice.  This year the judges were Melody Tomlinson, Willem Abraham, Lungani Mfeka, Malefa Ketle, Sanjay Singh, Carol Sanderson and Dave Walters. They chose Dlamini as the queen.  Poppy Ramodibe was first runner-up, and Victoria Shongwe second runner-up.  Kgaugelo Ntini won the charity category, Zaza Letsholo was the social media personality and Elna Botha the winner of both the corporate social investment and most photogenic categories.
