 Racing, winning and also becoming designers, of sorts, so as to reward the rest of the team for a season’s hard graft, nerves of steel and continuous support.  Yvonne and Bianca Theunissen recently finished the Ermelo Regional Rally in style by winning their class (NR1) and finishing fifth overall.

Bianca said, “The rally started on a challenging note.  First our service bakkie broke down and the second service vehicle hit a buck, which meant that we really arrived at the start in the nick of time. The roads were rough, but as has now become the norm, Yvonne was spot on on the notes enabling us to race at a good pace.  When we hit a hole in the road, the service crew was right there to ensure that all is well with our Baby Hulk (the Opel). Other than this, a couple of big jumps, some areas where we really had to drive with care and others where we could simply go for gold (flat out).  We were truly grateful to finish in one piece and also third overall for the Regional Championship.” To reward all the members of the team, Yvonne went into hiding to produce trophies for everyone. These were handed over at a braai held to celebrate the team’s 2018 success. Dad, Nick Theunissen said, “The girls really made us all proud.
