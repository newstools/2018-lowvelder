 The storm moved from Hazyview towards Nelspruit, Karino, Malelane and Komatipoort, and caused considerable damage to orange and macadamia trees,according to Kobus van Niekerk, a macadamia consultant in Karino. He had been working in the area since 1990 and had never experienced a hailstorm of such severity. James Chance, CEO of Tomahawk Estates, said this hailstorm had been preceded by another storm a week earlier that destroyed about 100ha of citrus.

Lychee and mango trees had also been defoliated, but it was too early to say what the impact of the storm would be on the lychee and mango harvest in November and December.  The disaster had an acute impact on the local community as large numbers of people were employed as pickers and packers. “This means that these workers will not earn nearly as much money as in previous years,” he said.
