  BARBERTON – Hi-Tech Security Barberton’s Sakkie Dednam said lightning struck the school at exactly 02:54.
“One of my officers saw the lightning hit the roof and travel over the rooftops. My guys got there quickly, about three minutes later. The school was ablaze already.” Photo by Rian Prinsloo.  He said the lightning had caused an electrical fire so all the cables had been burned. “The top floor was burned down and the bottom floor has water damage.”
Dednam said the school had a good reputation in the area. “It is one of the best schools in our area. They have fantastic matric results every year. The children who attend are not from rich families. They have a about 800 learners. I am worried what is going to happen to them as it will take years to rebuild.”  DA councillor Elsabe Jacobs said she had also been called to the scene in the early hours of the morning. “I just want to say we were grateful to the people of Mbombela municipality who responded so quickly to the scene and fought the fire. They had the biggest fire truck there. The principal of the school was also on the scene.”  Yesterday, in White River in Sondersorg in Kings Kingsview Ex 2, a storm which lasted about five minutes at around 14:30 caused a tree to fall on a vehicle. The owner had lent it to her fiancé who called her to notify her of the damage.
