 MBOMBELA – Spectators are in for an all day and all night rocking performance at this year’s Kishugu Lowveld Air Show, both in the air and on the ground. Lowvelders are always eager for family friendly and value for money events and on Saturday May 12 that is exactly what visitors can expect. For as little as R150 per adult and R100 per pupil, aviation enthusiasts will be able to enjoy great entertainment with no hidden costs. And what’s more, preschoolers will enjoy free entrance. This year’s air show theme is Rock the Runway, and the entire day will be centred around rock ‘n’ roll music. Kicking off the day early, the air show will be officially opened by revving Harley-Davidson bikers and fearless skydivers, followed by an entire day of aerobatic delight by some of the best pilots in the country. The organisers have arranged the top of their class performers to showcase their talents at the Kishugu Lowveld Air Show. And forget about bored kids, parents will be delighted to know they can let their children play in a safe, secure and fun area provided by the specialised Just for Fun team (well-known for their huge kids’ entertainment area at the Uplands Festival each year) at no additional cost. But do not plan on going home once the spectacular fireworks display is over as we will be burning the midnight oil with some smashing rock hits at a live concert. The Rock the Runway after-party starts during the fireworks show and will carry on late into the night (parents be sure to organise a babysitter well in advance as you don’t want to miss this party). Get ready to unplug your Saturday at this year’s show on May 12. Don’t get punk’d. Rock your budget by buying your tickets in advance.
