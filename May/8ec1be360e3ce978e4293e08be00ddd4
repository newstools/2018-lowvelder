 MBOMBELA – A modern-day version of Robin Hood is the perfect way to explain Penryn’s Senior Prep play for 2018.
The play entitled Robby Loxley was seen on Penryn’s chapel stage from April 23 to 25. All children from grades four to seven participated.  “The setting of our story takes place in Nottingham. King Richard has gone to a faraway land and justice is left in the sheriff’s hand,” teacher and director Jacqui van As explained.  “The sheriff of Nottingham is not very nice and he taxes the villagers and enjoys shooting people for fun. There is only one person in the land who manages to get under his skin and that is Robby Loxley.”
Robby Loxley and his gang are outlaws who are not very good at robbing people. Marian and her friends are contracted by Robby to cook for the men. The girls are not really good at cooking, all they can do is fry – that’s why it’s always “Fryday” in the forest. The girls get tired of the abuse and decide to go back to Nottingham. Robby and his men are desperate to get the girls back. They decide to go to Nottingham disguised as woman to win a bag of gold at an archery contest, so they can buy proper groceries for the girls to cook with.  At the fair, Robby is in for a big surprise when Marian beats him in the archery contest. He is then reunited with his mom and dad in the most unexpected way. The play was tons of fun and light-hearted with a few lessons in equality.
“The pupils and staff members alike have had a lot of fun preparing for this production,” Van As said.
