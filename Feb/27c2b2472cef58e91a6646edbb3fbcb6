 Platforms like Instagram, YouTube, Facebook and Twitter have become a playing field for fraudsters seeking to catch unsuspecting consumers off guard. Kovelin Naidoo, Chief Cyber Security Officer at FNB, says although social media scams in South Africa are not yet prevalent, compared to our global counterparts; the reality is that they do exist.  He identifies the following problems and offers advice on how to avoid it.  “Never share your banking details with strangers and think twice before sending money to someone you recently met online or haven’t met in person yet,” Naidoo warns. “Dating and romance scammers often lower your defences by appealing to your compassionate side in order to take advantage of you,” says Naidoo. “Fraudsters can steal your information and use it illegally by impersonating you,” he points out. “Do not allow your account to be used by another person to deposit or transact on. This can put you in serious trouble with authorities as allowing proceeds of crime to be laundered through your bank account, knowingly or unknowingly, is a criminal offence. Furthermore, never open a bank account in your name on behalf of a person you have met on social media platforms, irrespective of the circumstances,” says Naidoo.
