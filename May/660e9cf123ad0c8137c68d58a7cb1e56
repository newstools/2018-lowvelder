Aramex Global Shopper (AGS) is a unique online shopping platform that not only gives addresses in 23 countries from which you can shop, but also gets your package delivered to you in a jiffy. AGS has been around since 2000, but was only launched in South Africa in 2014. When shopping online, certain online retailers don’t ship to South Africa, and this is where AGS comes in as it breaks the barriers of international shipping by providing you with 23 “local” delivery addresses to use when you check out on the retailer’s website. For example, Buy from Ted Baker in London, use your Aramex London Address.  Upon registration, each customer receives a unique mailbox number, e.g: NLP1265 which AGS uses to identify your actual address when it comes to your time of delivery. Delivery normally takes place 5 to 10 days after Aramex have received your order. Shipments charges are calculated according to the package’s weight and are much more cost effective than most other shipping services. You can pay for your shipping on either the Aramex Global Shopper app, which is available on iOS or Android, or on the Aramex Global Shopper website.
