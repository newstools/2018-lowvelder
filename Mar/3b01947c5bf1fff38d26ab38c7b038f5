MBOMBELA – “Appearance versus reality” means something different to everyone. To some guests of Island Boutique Lodge, it articulates their expectations versus what they experienced at the lodge located at 10 Edith Street. To residents of Edith Street, it refers to a confusing court order obtained relating to the same property. The court order was granted in the Mbombela Regional Court.
