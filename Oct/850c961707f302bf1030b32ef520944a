Ngomane has encouraged the cattle farmers to consider employing people they know. “In cases of theft it becomes easy even for the police to investigate such cases.” He further called on livestock owners to take their livestock farming seriously so that incidents of livestock theft are reduced.  Ngomane stated that farmers must ensure that the places in which they keep their livestock are properly fenced and also properly branded, “so that when they wander they are able to find them.” ALSO READ: Mpumalanga Show ready to impress This was said during a public participation programme (Imbizo) that took place on Sunday at Moloto in Thembisile Hani Local Municipality.
