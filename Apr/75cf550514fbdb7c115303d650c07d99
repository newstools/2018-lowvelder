 MBOMBELA –Lowvelder previously reported that Esterhuizen was identified as a candidate for this experimental surgery and that he would be one of five people receiving this implant. At the age of 23 Esterhuizen lost his right eye in a car accident and damaged the nerve of his left eye. The Orion, which communicates with an external camera, was implanted into his brain with the hopes of giving him his vision back. After the operation, Esterhuizen made a post on Facebook stating that he was recovering very well and that he had a major headache. At this stage he showed no side effects of the operation and was released from hospital on Saturday March 31.

I feel honoured to be part of this programme. It could be life-changing to millions of other blind people,” Esterhuizen said.  “According to the doctor we will start testing the device in two to four weeks, but things are looking good.” Esterhuizen also started a blog called The journey out of darkness, telling his story to the world and hoping to help others struggling with blindness.
