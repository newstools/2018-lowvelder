 MBOMBELA – The Africanis is the real African dog – shaped in Africa, by Africa. In fact, its African heritage goes back 7 000 years. WATCH: Large lion pride walking in the road Some even believe that SA’s best-loved dog hero, Jock of the Bushveld, contrary to popular belief, could well have been a Africanis and not a Staffordshire bull terrier.
There is no question about it – the Africanis breed is a special one. Yet they are often abandoned, homeless or rescued from townships or rural areas. In the hope of finding them loving homes, Pro Life Pet Rescue, which currently has around 200 animals up for adoption, has reduced their Africanis adoption fees to an all-time low of just R250 each. To own an Africanis puppy will only cost you R650. The adoption fee includes up-to-date vaccinations, deworming, a microchip and sterilisation (at six months of age).
You will also receive a free grooming voucher from Dirty Dogs, a 15 per cent discount voucher from Pet Worx, basic or puppy training from Lowveld Dog Training (you just pay the registration fee), and a free walk at Happy Hound. WATCH: Snakes have no friends in the bush Standard adoption procedures and home checks apply. The Africanis is an extremely intelligent, loyal and healthy breed. They are easy to train as they strive to please their owners. The Africanis requires very little grooming and is a low-maintenance dog, making them the ideal pet.
