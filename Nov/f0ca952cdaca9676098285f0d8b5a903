I want the community to be able to design something and still be able to sell it themselves. Some people design things and because they do not know how to market it, someone goes and buys it for a cheaper price, then packages it and sells it for a lot of money.  So if we start such projects, they will be able to know where to go and how to sell their products. We also need to do awareness in the rural areas so that they can be aware of life-threatening diseases,” she said. Mrs Africa is a pageant that unites 54 countries. The crowning will be held on December 1 in Rustenburg, North West Province. Ochan is a businesswoman, owner of the OT Deyo Med Aesthetic Clinic, founder and patron of the Lucia O Foundation, and participates on numerous councils and chambers within the community.
