 MBOMBELA – The popular awards, in which the public choose their favourite places at which to eat, shop and all manner of things, will be made on September 12. Voting opens on 20 July. Until then anyone can choose their most popular businesses in the city – any business at all. You don’t have to be nominated to participate. Simply visit the voting website, select the category which you are entering, and type the name of your choice. This year businesses in Mbombela as well as nearby White River are eligible for the awards.
In addition, the categories have changed a little from 2017’s competition.
