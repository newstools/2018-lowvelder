 This World Rhino Day, Care for Wild Rhino Sanctuary (CFW) will celebrate the day by honouring seven baby rhino who arrived at the sanctuary in 2015, orphaned, hurt and in need of healing, love, and care. Now, those baby rhino have grown up and have become a part of a special, new family.  Three years ago, Konica Minolta South Africa acknowledged the plight of rhino in Southern Africa and partnered with CFW, to assist in a sustainable way to save rhino. In 2015, the company adopted seven orphaned baby rhino: Annie, River, Tyson, Venus, Meha, Tank and Satara, who were lovingly named the ‘Magnificent Seven’. The company covered all maintenance costs relating to food, shelter, and medication for the seven rhino. The ‘Magnificent Seven’ have since been released into the reserve that surrounds the orphanage.  Konica Minolta South Africa donates in excess of R1 million to the sanctuary annually, which helps tremendously in taking care of the rhino. According to CFW, the cost for care and food for one single rhino is estimated at almost R20,000 a month.  On World Rhino Day, 22 September 2018, CFW will be hosting a group of young children to teach them all about the rhino and how important they are. “We are focusing on youth awareness and education. Not only will we be introducing the children to the KMSA’s famous Magnificent Seven, but to the other baby rhino as well,” says Dorota Ladosz, from CFW.
