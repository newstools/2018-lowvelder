 UPDATE – A generator thought to be owned by the police, is in actual fact, owned by Vodacom.  Vodacom’s spokesman said due to Mpumalanga having irregular power outages due to load-shedding, they had a generator which switched on automatically when electricity outages happened.  “There is a fault in the power switch which transfers the generator to electricity. We are working on the problem and should be sorted out by tonight.” This is after residents complained about the generator running continously since last Wednesday.  Residents were under the impression the generator belonged to the police who rent offices in the building. Police spokesman Sgt Gerald Sedibe confirmed that the generator was not theirs. “Unfortunately the police do not own a generator for our offices.”  MBOMBELA –  According to the residents who have apartments right next door to the offices, the generator was even filled while it was running. “We cannot think anymore with the noise. We are terrified that the generator explodes while they are filling it as well,” said M5 Funeral’s Hennie Borman. He said residents had also complained to him as the generator was on day and night. “How can they keep it going for so long? This must be costing a fortune to run.” Police spokesman Sgt Gerald Sedibe was unable to comment on the matter. Lowvelder will update readers as soon as the police respond to queries.
