 MBOMBELA – This was revealed when the national Community Police Forum chairman, Kevin Pillay, chaired the monthly meeting in the Mbombela municipality boardroom on Tuesday night. “Many of the strategies implemented here will be set out nationwide. Mbombela has a very good record regarding the community working together with the police,” Pillay said. Mbombela station commander, Brig Prince Hlupheka Ngobeni, also chaired the meeting alongside Pillay. The latter started off by stating that he did not want to discuss much of the crime statistics released last week, as there would be an official media briefing regarding the provincial crime stats. “However, I can say that Mbombela did see a decline.” With regards to the crime around the country, Pillay added that the police would enhance the Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences unit and allocate more resources to domestic violence and crimes against women and children. He said matters regarding sex workers would also fall under the unit. Another unit, which was also on the agenda, was a new gang-related and drug unit for the police. “Neighborhood watches, CPF and security companies will have a new policy framework which will be implemented between October 15 to 20.” He added that all secondary stakeholders would have to wear blue reflector jackets in the future, for identification purposes. Ngobeni said that problematic areas in the city that police would be keeping an eye on included Bester Street and Samora Machel Drive. “We have found rapes are escalating in the city and most of the victims are minors.” Ngobeni said he was promised 70 new police members due to the high court, which should be opening October 3 next year.
