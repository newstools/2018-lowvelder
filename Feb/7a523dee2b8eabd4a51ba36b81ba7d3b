 Dash cam users should remember two things: Having recorded what happens on a public road is not illegal per se. However, when the video material has been edited or cut and no longer represents a true account of what had happened, it becomes risky. Examples include online naming and shaming others for contravening traffic laws or driving recklessly. By uploading a video representing what happened in part, you expose only the alleged wrongdoer’s deed. Your footage does not reflect what happened before or after that. This may exclude a reasonable defence from the public eye, making the driver seem guilty when there is an excuse for his behaviour.  The same goes for other alleged crimes caught on camera. If it transpires that the alleged wrongdoer was in fact innocent, you may face a civil claim. In a worst case scenario, a criminal defamation claim may be brought against you.
