MACHADODORP –  The accident occured on a sharp turn. Eyewitnesses said the truck pushed the bakkie for about a kilometre and a half before stopping. ER24 paramedic, Ansie Pretorius said the driver of the bakkie, a male, was killed instantly. “We managed to get the female passenger out of the bakkie. We tried to save her life, but we could not.” Pretorious said nobody else was injured in the accident. According to her, both people had no identification on them, so ER24 was unable to provide even the deceased’s ages.
