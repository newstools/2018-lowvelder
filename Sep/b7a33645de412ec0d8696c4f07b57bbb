ADSL (Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line) is a high-speed Internet access service that uses your telephone line to send and receive Internet data at much faster speeds than a conventional dial-up connection. With ADSL you are connected to the Internet 24 hours a day and can also make and receive telephone calls while online. Wireless Internet enables wireless connectivity to the Internet via radio waves rather than wires on a person’s home computer, laptop, smartphone or similar mobile device. Wireless Internet can be accessed directly through cellular providers. While most wireless Internet options lack the high speed of landline broadband Internet connections such as cable and DSL. Wi-Fi hotspots and wireless LANs are also options for wireless Internet connectivity. In these cases, Internet connectivity is typically delivered to a network hub via a wired connection like satellite, cable, DSL or fiber optics and then made available to wireless devices via a wireless access point. Fibre is a bundle of fibre optic threads made of pure glass each about the diameter of a human hair. It uses light instead of electricity to carry a digital data signal. Fibre is able to transmit information at virtually unlimited speed and capacity, delivering superfast speeds. It is the most advanced, stable and super-fast broadband connection on offer and is not affected by weather elements.
