 The attraction of a varied mix of classic and modern motorcycles in a convivial atmosphere once again proved a successful recipe for the Classic Motorcycle Club’s (CMC) annual 1000 Bike Show. It was staged at the Germiston Sports Club on June 30 and July 1, and this year the weather played along too, with a mild weekend just before the icy cold snap hit Gauteng. “We were very satisfied with the good support the show received from thousands of visitors, and we once again had a high standard of motorcycles on display as well as a wide range of trade stands,” commented Rusty Thorns, chairman of the Classic Motorcycle Club (CMC), which is celebrating its 50th anniversary this year. As is usual at this show, there were a number of unusual machines on display. One that attracted plenty of attention was Alan Heynes’ 1916 Autoped, which was made in New York and is claimed to be the world’s first scooter, with the rider standing upright as the powered front wheel hauled this unusual two-wheeler along the road.

Another unusual bike on display was a bicycle powered by 50cc Zundapp engine – an original moped dating back to 1956. The machine is owned by Maynard Marshall and requires some work to get it running.

Neville said he bought the motorcycle three years ago and then rebuilt it completely. He also won the class for Japanese motorcycles over 250cc with his immaculate Suzuki GT750, a water-cooled three-cylinder two-stroke dating back to the 1970s. Brett Allan’s Yamaha XS650 Chopper took the Best on Show honours in the Custom motorcycle category.
