 Monday marked the last day of 16 Days of Activism for No Violence Against Women and Children 2018 campaign.
It was launched on November 25, under the theme: #HearMeToo: End Violence Against Women and Children. GRIP also played a role in creating awareness in the City of Mbombela. Linky Thusi from the organisation said they held various events, including a community dialogue session with 46 young women at Mbombela Stadium. GRIP partnered with #TheTotalShutDown, an organisation that focuses on fighting gender-based violence against women.

Twenty-four demands were submitted on August 1 to the president of South Africa, Cyril Ramaphosa.
Demand number 23 is “A sustained media campaign for 365 days by all departments, led by Government Communication and Information Systems, providing information including awareness”. “This is one of those demands we really focused on during the dialogue,” Thusi said. In August women delivered a memorandum to the government. In almost all the provinces there was a shutdown march by women. They all submitted their memorandums at their provincial legislature offices. Each demand has a deadline next to it. GRIP is a non-profit organisation that has helped more than 45 000 survivors of rape and domestic abuse, from the age of four to 80 years old. It depends entirely on donated funds and fund-raising initiatives. The MEC for community safety, security and liaison, Pat Ngomane led the opening of the 16 Days of Activism provincial ceremony in Zwelisha.
