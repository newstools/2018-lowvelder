They do not have a place to go, and we feel that the department can use the money on other things, such as getting beds or building a laundry. We think they want to do a quick job and keep some of the funds,” she said.  The department says the decision to renovate the nurses’ home was taken after engineers reported the building was unsafe.
“The report was tabled in the presence of organised labour, and Nehawu agreed that the building be renovated,” said Malamule.
