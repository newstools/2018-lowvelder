 WHITE RIVER – Families came out to enjoy the lovely sunshine and get their Christmas shopping done early. Tracey Russell, the organiser, said the stallholders were very pleased with their sales and with the turnout. She said if her stallholders are happy, she is happy.  “There’s been a lot of positive feedback, and we are happy to have again provided an opportunity for a niche market of exhibitors,” Russell said.

The prep school teachers also assisted at the credit card payment point, so it was a team effort all round.  Russell said they can’t wait for next year’s event, as it will be even bigger and better.
