A truly professional brand attracts like-minded people. As local and international property representatives, we are obsessed with the tiniest detail and pride ourselves on the highest success rate for show days.  When marketing and selling property, we take great care to ensure that the particular needs of our clients are met.  At Lew Geffen Sotheby’s International Realty, we offer up a transparent and knowledgeable approach to ensure that our clients are adequately informed and equipped to make the right decisions. We are committed to uplifting the professionalism of the real estate industry through service delivery.  Our brand is relied upon for expertise and discretion and we achieve this through utilizing various mediums of marketing.  One of these, the Sotheby’s referral system, collates buyers between areas and regions and ensure that we maintain a National database of all qualified buyers suitable for your property. These buyers will be introduced to your property on a private viewing basis.  Our property consultants are committed to negotiating the highest net market price, in the shortest period of time without compromising the integrity of your home. Marketing a home requires the right asking price, a well-structured marketing plan and an artful staging of the purchase process.  It is our intention to consistently create demand for your home rather than simply respond to enquiries and as such we are always striving to find new and effective ways to present properties to our clients.
