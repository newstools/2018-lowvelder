 MBOMBELA – The Square is located on Madiba Drive, a stone’s throw away from the SARS offices. For many years it was known as the Pick n Pay Centre. On Saturday, October 13 the centre was decorated with balloons and colourful square bunting for the It’s Your Party event. On the day an Honouring Our Heroes ceremony was held and preprimary schools were invited to choose and honour an organisation that they deemed heroes.  Pupils of Elizabeth Montessori, Chirpy Baby and Toddler Centre, Nellie Miere and Mosaïek made special thank you cards to honour these organisations – CANSA, Bossies Community Justice, Sanca and Nelspruit SPCA.
The Square donated R10 000 to each. KaMagugu Inclusive School’s marimba band serenaded the crowd with its on-point melodic sound. The Nelspruit Gymnastics Academy also stunned the guests with demonstrations, while the little ones had a chance to have fun on the giant jumping castle.
