 LYDENBURG – The power in Lydenburg and Sabie will remain on. This was decided by the High Court in Mbombela last Tuesday, after the business chambers of Lydenburg, Sabie and Graskop took 10 respondents to court over the power cuts experienced because of Eskom debt. According to Leon de Jager of the Lydenburg/Mashishing Business Chamber, the judge of the High Court ruled that the chambers’ case against Eskom and the other 10 respondents will be heard on March 18.

This means that we will have power for at least the next six months to a year,” De Jager said. TCLM owes Eskom R400 million. Last year the company issued a notice, in which residents were informed that two substations in Lydenburg and Mashishing and the whole of Sabie would be switched off for more than five hours per day.

Residents in these towns were left powerless from October 9 to December 27, 2017. This followed after the chambers’ first failed attempt to restore power by means of an urgent court interdict in the High Court in Mbombela. The chambers then directed the case to the Constitutional Court, but it was referred back to the High Court. The judge ordered that the power be restored immediately on December 27 last year.
