 MBOMBELA – “At the flea market he sold fireman’s aloes. He always heard me talking about BCJ and what the cause was about and he attended all the walks and drives.” At his stall he put up a BCJ banner and displayed a sign that read, “Ten per cent of all sales will go towards BCJ, thank you for your support.” Reece spent Sunday morning selling there and told every customer after they bought a plant that he was taking a percentage for BCJ and what it was all about.  “The sales at the flea market were not going so well, so after it closed, I was hoping I could go and relax on the couch at home, but he surprised me by letting me know that due to the low sales, we needed to go to White River Bagdad Centre to sell some more,” Maurice retaled. The day ended with a R640 turnover. Reece sent BCJ an envelope with R64. “Every cent counts and I am super impressed with his dedication as while other children were out playing, Reece was trying extremely hard to sell his aloes.”  BCJ’s Albert Gryvenstein said he was impressed by the dedication Reece had shown to their cause at such a young age. “This is exactly the type of support we need. It does not matter how much a person can afford. If everyone helped, we could achieve a lot in the fight against crime.”
