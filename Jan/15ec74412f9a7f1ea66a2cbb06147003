One of the main roads leading to the Kruger National Park has been inaccessible since this morning. A source told Hazyview Herald that protesters have completely blocked the R40 adjacent to police station, using minibus taxis. Reynold  Thakhuli, SANParks spokesman, advises tourists to use an alternative route. “It is best to avoid the area and use an alternative gate like Numbi to reach the park. Should you get caught and suspect that you might not make your camp in time, please phone the park to notify them,” he said.  It is alleged that a taxi dispute between two associations is at the heart of the congestion. Local security company Spes-Plan, has arranged a convoy in order to accompany parents trying to pick up their kids at Numbi Primary. Updated: Community ‘saves the magic’ at Phabeni
