He said the mine management has failed to respond to challenges raised by community members previously. “We want the local mines to employ local people, especially the youth. We want them to further provide learnership programmes, skills development and empower local emerging businesspeople by offering them job opportunities within Barberton Mines,” said Malandule. Except, Fairview, other mine operations under the Barberton Mines include Sheba and New Consort. Israel Dlamini, Barberton Mines’ human resource practitioner, accepted the memorandum from the community members on behalf of Barberton Mines. He promised that the mine management will respond on the residents demand on Monday. The outcome was not yet known at the time of going to press.
