 MBOMBELA – This is the third market of its kind that the restaurant has held and it focused specifically on health and Mother’s Day. “We own both the Little Karoo Coffee Shop and Creative Minds Training Centre, and our main objective is to feed your body, mind and soul through all that we do,” said Rowena Richardson. Except for the stalls that offered an array of gifts and health products, marketgoers also had the opportunity to have their blood sugar and blood pressure tested.  An optometrist and a biokineticist were also present to ensure that all facets of your health was looked after.
“We also do fitness assessments here today to help you realise your full potential,” Richardson said. The next night market will be on June 8 and it has a praise and worship theme. “We want to thank everyone from the community who has helped us thus far, and we want to invite everyone to partake in our next market and enjoy the praise and worship with us,” Richardson said.
