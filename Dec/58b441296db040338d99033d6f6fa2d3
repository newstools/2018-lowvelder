 MBOMBELA – Oscar Benjamin was driving when he saw smoke coming out of his bonnet. He stopped and got out. Luckily he had three small fire extinguishers handy, “for when the need arises”, he told Lowvelder. It was shortly after 16:00 on Friday afternoon. He was standing in front of the BP garage in Riverside. People from the car dealerships across the road saw the flames, and him attempting to extinguish it, and rushed to his aid. “They brought bigger fire extinguishers. There were about five people helping me.” They managed to extinguish the fire.
