 MBOMBELA – With the help of Nelspruit Ford and SPAR Lowveld DC, The Grove managed to drop two loads of necessities off at Pro-Life. “This is the biggest blessing we have had in a while. We were running out of things like puppy food, cat litter and cleaning supplies and we received an abundance of it today,” said Karin Erasmus, Pro-Life founder. This is the eighth charity that The Grove SUPERSPAR has helped as part of their Supporting our Community charity drive that started last October. During this drive the community has the opportunity to nominate a charity. The Grove SUPERSPAR team – Nick de Clercq, Adrian Michael, Enoch Malope, Godfrey Hlophe and Gloria Nkosi. Every month has a specific charity locals can donate necessities to. The Grove SUPERSPAR will then match all the donations the public has made. “The community really got behind this month’s charity drive and it has been our most successful one thus far,” said spokesman, Barry Odendaal. The charity for June is Sandla Healing Centre which takes care of less fortunate children between the ages of one and 18 years. “We are calling on the community to donate non-perishable food, sanitary towels, toiletries and stationary,” Odendaal said, adding that it has been a privilege to work with all the charities thus far.
