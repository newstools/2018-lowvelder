The first guided hike of this scenic section of the Greater Blyde River Trail is on Saturday February 10. Kevin Ruthven is managing this project for the Mpumalanga Parks and Tourism Agency. He recently invited drone flyer Alicia Whitting to record some of the spectacular waterfalls on the route. To join this first trial walk, contact Lowveld Hikers on Facebook or speak to Ruthven on 076-737-3910.
