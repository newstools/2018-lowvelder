 White River won the battle in April by five points, 29-24. White River has won only one more match this season and find themselves fourth on the log. A win tomorrow will keep them in the hunt for a play-off place, a loss will put them under tremendous pressure to qualify for the semi-finals. Nelspruit are sitting pretty on second place on the log table. A victory tomorrow will take them one step closer to a home semi-final. Recent form counts for little when these two teams face each other. In the past few seasons matches have gone down to the wire and Nelspruit will make a huge error if they think avenging April’s defeat is a given. This derby is club rugby rivalry at its best. Its about who can say, “We won” at the end of 80 minutes of brutal rugby. Rugby fans and their families are invited to attend the thrilling encounters at Nelspruit Rugby Club. Food and beverages will be on sale.
