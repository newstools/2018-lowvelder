 WHITE RIVER – It is often said that a dog is a man’s best friend. This proved true on Sunday when locals took part in the fifth annual Uplands Doggie Walk.
Participants paid R50 entrance and received a goody bag, a dog bandana and free vaccination for their pets, after which they walked the Uplands Beat of about four kilometres. The event started at 09:00 and walkers lined up from early on. The funds raised were in aid of White River Animal Hospital’s Welfare Fund. “We have had more than 200 dogs today. That is already more than the previous year,” Hanlie Erasmus from the hospital said.
Along the beat, the grade threes and their parents had stalls where refreshments were up for sale and photos could be taken. “The school is turning 90 this year. The beat that they are walking is full of interesting historic sights along the way and this is also a great way to raise funds and give back to the community,” Uplands Preparatory teacher Tania Hattingh said. The four-legged family members also had a chance to interact with one another and learn to socialise. Also read: Taking your health to heart
