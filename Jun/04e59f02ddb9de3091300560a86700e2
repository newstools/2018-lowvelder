 MBOMBELA – The mascots lined up at the shopping centre between 10:00 and 12:00 as part of the very first Mascot Day. It included Mbombela favourites Bugzy from Citybug, Frikkie die Feesvark met Vlerke from Innibos and SPAR’s very own Floof. Other mascots included the Duracell bunny, the Simba Chips lion, Mickey Mouse, Barney the Dinosaur and Winnie the Pooh. Seth Schrenk was excited to see the Spar Floof in store. The children ran up to the mascots with squeals of delight and the parents declared it was a brilliant initiative by Crossing SUPERSPAR.”We just wanted to have a fun little day for the community and entertain the children while their parents are shopping,” said SPAR spokesman Barry Odendaal. “We are hoping to make this an annual event and that everybody had tons of fun today.” Marizel McDuling, Susan Oosthuyse and Gerhard Marais surrounded by some of the mascots. He added that they originally only aimed for about 10 mascots, but more than 20 showed up. The Lowveld & Escarpment Fire Protection Association’s (Lefpa) mascot Bokkie was also part of the line-up. Lefpa spokesman Queen Khoza said that it was also a great opportunity for them to teach children about the dangers of fires. READ ALSO: Coffee meets chocolate at Crossing SUPERSPAR
