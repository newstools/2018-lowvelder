 NELSVILLE – Betty’s Haven Orphanage went up in flames last night. Nobody was injured. Betty Mandlazi has been running the centre for years. Her daughter, Sonto Mahlangu, explained that the structure remains but everything inside has been lost. “Everything is gone,” she said. “The beds, the clothes, fridges, food.” They were able to retrieve the 16 children who live at the centre. Mahlangu, who lives next door, has taken them in, but they are planning to move back to the centre.
