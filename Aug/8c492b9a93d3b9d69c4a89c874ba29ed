The Department of Home Affairs is today, 10 August 2018, experiencing system downtime due to power supply outage at SITA which has affected all offices across the country. Offices are unable to render all services due to HANIS, National Population Register and Live Capture systems that are not working. All Birth, Marriages, Death, Smart ID and Passport services are affected. SITA and Home Affairs Technicians are investigating the problem, and clients will be updated on when services will be restored. Home Affairs apologises for the inconvenience caused to all its clients. This is from a media release issued by Government Communications and Information Systems.
