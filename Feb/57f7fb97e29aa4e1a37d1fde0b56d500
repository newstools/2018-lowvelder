 MBOMBELA – While the country’s western provinces are set to remain fairly dry and rain-free, rainfall has shifted in favour of the Lowveld.
There is, however, a cause for concern as the South African Weather Services (SAWS) has issued a warning for heavy rain that may lead to localised flooding on Sunday. Very similar conditions to that of Tuesday night, is expected for most parts of the Lowveld,” warned an official of the Department of Disaster Management.

In Mbombela, members of the community recorded between 45 and 85 millimetres in parts of Steiltes and Uitkyk Road.
More than 75 millimetres were recorded in Barberton, with similar amounts in the White River and Plaston areas. Residents of Skukuza and Malalane measured a little less, with amounts ranging between 16 and 28 milimetres.
This caused most local dams to show either a slight or sharp increase. On average, however, the dams only increased by 2,69 per cent in the last 10 days, but there is a significant increase compared to last year. On average, Lowveld dams showed an increase of 10,18 per cent in the last year and currently sits on an average of 78 per cent.
The official said that even though #DayZero is not on the cards for the Lowveld, we can not become comfortable. Taps in Cape Town are expected to run dry on July 9 due to a decline in water usage. The official commended Lowvelders for their effort to conserve water, but added that we are far from where we need to be.
He again emphasised that we don’t live in a rainy country with occasional droughts, we live in a water-scarce country with occasional rain. “South Africa is a water-stressed country, and the only way to answer to the demand for water that could potentially outstrip the supply in the dry season, lies in people changing their attitude and thus their behaviour to use water more wisely,” he said.
The SAWS predicts light at the end of the tunnel as more rain is expected for the rest of the rainy season.
The El Niño-Southern Oscillation is expected to remain in a weak La Niña phase through to early autumn.
This suggests that above-normal rainfall is expected later in the summer, but can extend towards early autumn for the far north-eastern parts of the country.

A quick rise in water levels of streams (even empty ones) might take place, therefore, you should be careful when crossing rivers or streams by foot and vehicle. Drivers are advised to slow down and use their headlights in misty and rainy conditions.
The department provided the following tips, should localised flooding occur:
• Do not attempt to drive through flooded areas‚ even if the water looks shallow enough to cross
• Leave your vehicle if it stalls and immediately move to higher ground
• Never drive into water that covers the road, you do not know how deep it is or whether the road underneath has been washed away
• During heavy rains be on special alert near dips in the highway and near low-lying bridges
• Exercise caution‚ especially at night when visibility is poor
• Pedestrians must avoid areas where water is flowing rapidly
• Keep children away from playing in drainage ditches or storm-water drains or areas where water is easily accumulated. This is a video taken by Marlene Hurter in 2016.
