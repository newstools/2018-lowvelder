 MBOMBELA – A 62-year-old man was shot and killed in his home by unknown suspects in The Rest, plot number 66. Police spokesman Capt Zandile Gqawa said they were looking for suspects in connection with the murder and house robbery. “The incident took place yesterday at about 22:00.”  According to information at the police’s disposal, the man was watching television and his wife was in the bedroom when three suspects stormed into the house. “He alerted his wife to lock herself in the bedroom and to press the panic button. A scuffle ensued between the suspects and the victim and shots were fired. The man was shot in the chest and was certified dead at the scene.” ALSO READ: Two pedestrians killed on R40 this weekend Hi-Tech Security Lowveld’s operation manager Callum Mac Pherson said their armed response disturbed the suspects who then fled into the bush. “A television which was taken from the house was found in the nearby bush.” Bossies Community Justice’s (BCJ) Albert Gryvenstein also responded to the scene to assist in preserving it and to help search for the suspects. “I believe it was due to Callen Herbst from Hi-Tech Security’s swift response that the suspects did not harm the wife.” No arrests have been made as yet. Anyone with information which can lead to the arrest of these perpetrators can contact Det Col Ernest Maoka on 013-759-1108. Alternatively, please contact BCJ’s Gryvenstein on 082-567-5212. Police have requested the media not to report the man’s identity as yet as not all of his family members have been notified.
