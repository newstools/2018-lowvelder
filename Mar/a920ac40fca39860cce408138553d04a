Safety is one of our priorities and for this reason we put immense effort into ensuring a safe road for all N4 road users. We monitor our road closely, and take corrective action to improve road safety at prominent accident spots, working hand-in-hand with law enforcement authorities and Emergency Services personnel. We believe in being proactive, rather than reactive, and therefore daily route patrols are conducted by TRACAssist which, together with the TRAC Helpdesk, is available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year to assist road users with emergencies, incidents or queries.  The TRAC Helpdesk is a core element of our operations as it is the link between the road users and the different departments of the company. It also facilitates communication between TRACAssist, state and private emergency assistance stakeholders and road users.  TRACAssist is our emergency roadside and accident response unit that is made up of teams stationed along the N4 Toll Route and are on call 24/7 to assist with any road related emergency and incident (including breakdowns).  The TRAC Helpdesk is the mediator between the road users and TRACAssist meaning that assistance on the N4 Toll Route is simply a phone call away.  TRACAssist is roadside assistance service that is free of charge. Road users will only have to pay for the additional services/items that are required to solve their emergency (e.g petrol, tow truck or a new tyre), however our TRACAssist teams can facilitate the acquisition of these at no extra cost. Furthermore, they offer road users the peace of mind, and comfort, of ‘never being alone’ in any situation on the N4 toll road as all TRACAssist officers are trained to secure accident and incident scenes to ensure the safety of all road users.  TRACAssist and the TRAC Helpdesk is available in both South Africa and Mozambique and can be reached on the following numbers: South Africa – 0800 87 22 64 or (+27) 82 881 4444
