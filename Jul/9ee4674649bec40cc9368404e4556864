 MBOMBELA – Petrus Sydney Mabuza was released on bail of R250 000 at the Nelspruit High Court today. This came after Mabuza appealed the sentence of the White River Magistrate court, who did not grant him bail. According to Captain Leroy Bruwer from the Hawks, the High Court granted Mabuza bail as it decided he was not a flight risk. Mabuza was arrested on in the beginning of June with three other accused, who were charged on six counts related to rhino poaching. Nozwelo Mahumane was released on bail earlier in June, while it was placed on record that Moshe Thobela and Romance Khoza withdrew their bail application.

The defence however argued that he is well loved in the community, he suffers from pain due to a previous car accident and that he would not be able to flee or to tamper with the ongoing case against him. Jamie Joseph from the environmental organisation Save the Wild, who assisted the Hawks in Mabuza’s arrest, says the granting of bail is a slap in the face for them. “They are celebrating at his home and in the streets of Hazyview tonight. We are deeply upset about the release and this fight is not over.” READ ALSO: The person behind ‘Mr Big’
