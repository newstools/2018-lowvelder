Yuletide cheer and carols were sounding through the corridors as joy was brought to all in Rustig Old Age Home for their annual Christmas tea. But, unknown to the residents, another surprise would soon be revealed to them by the team of Hough & Bremner, with the White River Care Buddies.  All the residents were gathered in the common room as the tables were set with a sweet and savoury feast for them, which was graciously sponsored by Pick n Pay White River.  As Archie Bremner entered the room, the crowd knew that something special was going to be announced. He gave a short speech on the meaning of Christmas and in it came… A brand-new wheelchair! Exclamations of glee filled the room as residents marvelled at the sight of their new gift from their angels. But, the gifting wasn’t over: there was a second surprise! Soon the entire team were handing out giant chocolate slabs for everyone to delight in.  This was truly a special day and the team of Hough & Bremner were glad that they were able to bring joy to the many friendly residents of Rustig Old Age Home. Hough & Bremner would also like to wish all of their loyal clients a merry Christmas and a prosperous 2019.
