 MBOMBELA – There is a saying that goes, “It is always those who have the least who give away the most”. This was the case when KaMagugu Inclusive School decided to give back to the pupils of Laerskool Bergland on September 17. This school is located in a disadvantaged area and caters for children who have disabilities. According to Bergland spokesman, Marena Buitendag, the school brought their marimba band along to entertain the primary school learners. “Bergland, in turn, collected and donated 180 teddy bears to the school to use in their soft room,” Buitendag said.

The Bergland children enjoyed the show just as much as the KaMagugu children enjoyed the bears. ALSO READ: Grootouers word bederf by Laerskool Bergland
