 MBOMBELA â€“ A female goshawk was rescued this week at the Tshwane University of Technology (TUT) campus.
It appears as though the bird injured herself when she smashed into a window, since she was found in thick thorn bush near a broken office window. Marcelle Hoffmann of the SPCA Nelspruit branch came to her rescue, but suspected that her wing was broken.  She was taken to Van Wjik Street Animal Clinic where X-rays confirmed that both bones in the wing were broken.
Dr Jaco Coetzee and Dr Donny Engelbrecht stabilised the bird, pinned the wing and kept her for observation. On Wednesday it was reported that she was recovering well and plans were made to relocate her to the Dullstroom Bird of Prey and Rehabilitation Centre over the coming weekend. Once fully recuperated, she will be brought back to the Mbombela area to be released on home ground. See the video:
