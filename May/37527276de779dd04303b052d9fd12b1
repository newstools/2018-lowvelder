 Community members from Joe Slovo in Tekwane North outside Mbombela were protesting at the local municipal offices on Wednesday morning demanding water. According to one of their leaders, Calson Msimangu, they are tired of empty promises. “We want water and it is high time that they provide it to us. They promised they would start supplying water after we were marching two weeks ago but to our surprise we do not see any action.
