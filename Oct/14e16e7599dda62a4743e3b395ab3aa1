 WHITE RIVER – For one night a year, pupils, parents and the general public get to witness the pupils’ amazing skills. This year the exhibition formed part of the school’s 90th birthday celebrations.

The topic of the art was “Meet the Teacher” and required the learners to take photographs of staff members and paint them using multimedia.  Some stuck to paint, others added the physical parts that make up the daily work of the staff member depicted.  Near the entrance was a painting of executive headmaster Gary Sim, made by Nkosisphile Matsebula.  She said she had tried to depict him in a way he is not always seen by the school’s pupils and parents, and shows him beaming.  Teacher, Renata Stewart was on hand to share the history of the iconic Webster House, the central building which has become the heart of the school 90 years later.  Guests enjoyed cheese and wine, a food truck, as well as craft beer and gin, to make this final celebration of the school’s 90 years an evening to remember.
