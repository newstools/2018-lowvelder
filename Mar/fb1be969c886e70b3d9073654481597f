 MBOMBELA – CANSA Lowveld is in need of your help and it is as easy as filling up a R5 board. According to Mariolise le Roux, marketing assistant for the organisation, it is like completing a puzzle, only easier. “All you need to do is to collect a board from the CANSA Lowveld office or Unigrad College in Ferreira Street. Ask your friends, family, colleagues, strangers and anyone else to stick a R5 on the board. Once it’s filled up deposit the board at CASNA or at the upcoming weekend’s Relay for Life (RFL).

This initiative will be shared with the rest of RFL South Africa and the world. The number of filled boards we receive will become the benchmark challenge for other relays to do the same or to better the score. “Once again CANSA RFL Mbombela is the leader in helping others. The success of this initiative is in your hands,” said Le Roux.
