 The new loadshedding schedule with the affected areas has been released. Stage one loadshedding has been implemented again in Mbombela and surrounding areas. This will likely continue from 12:15 until 22:00 to save the emergency resources of Eskom. Eskom has released a press release where it asks residents to please save power with simple things they can do at home such as switching off lights and geysers that aren’t being used. Residents should also treat electrical points during loadshedding as if they are live. Stage 1 requires 1000MW to be rotationally loadshed nation-wide Stage 2 requires 2000 MW Stage 3 requires 3000 MW Stage 4 calls for up to 4000 MW to be rotationally loadshed nationally in that given period.
