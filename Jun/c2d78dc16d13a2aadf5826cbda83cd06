They reported such to Olifants Rest Camp. The ranger contacted his colleague at Houtbosrand. Broodryk said when the ranger went to investigate, two field rangers told him that an elephant had stormed them and they had to protect themselves.A few days later a rhino carcass was discovered in the same area and four R1 casings were found on the scene. The casings and two rifles belonging to the field rangers were sent for forensic tests. Results matched the casings with the rifles after which the field rangers were arrested.

Another three poachers were apprehended on Monday by rangers who had been following tracks for most of the day.
