 MBOMBELA – Cattle continue to use the Lowveld’s highways as footpaths.  On Friday afternoon the newspaper witnessed how livestock almost caused an accident on the N4 near the Cairn turnoff. Lowvelder has reported on several cattle-related accidents in the past, including one in which 11 people died when a taxi hit two cows last December, as well as a report of cattle disrupting the traffic on the N4 in April. According to TRAC N4 spokesman, Solange Soares-Nicholson, livestock owners are solely responsible for their cattle and it is their obligation to keep their animals within an enclosed area.

However, theft and damage of the barriers are a constant challenge which defeats the object of TRAC’s efforts,” Soares-Nicholson said, adding that they also erect warning signs in high-risk areas and also post warnings on social media when they are advised of roaming livestock. “In addition, although it isn’t our responsibility to keep the road clear of livestock, we have gone a step further in high-risk zones, such as near Matsulu and in Nkomazi, by contracting ‘livestock lookouts’ who cycle specific sections on a daily basis to ensure they remain livestock-free,” Soares-Nicholson said. In May the City of Mbombela released a statement that said that it has noted the risk of stray animals on public roads which compromises safety.
