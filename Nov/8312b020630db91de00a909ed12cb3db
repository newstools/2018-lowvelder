Upon their arrival in Pretoria they went to see the variety show Jukebox Hits.  “The show had the group on their feet, singing and dancing along with the cast. They were even asked by the cast to perform during half-time for the audience and did an a cappella version of “This is Me” from The Greatest Showman,” Steyn said. The choir also performed at the very exclusive courtyard of Menlyn Maine as well as at the St Peters retirement village.”Aside from singing, they also got to enjoy the afternoon at BOUNCE, where they got to jump, climb, zip line and bounce to their heart’s content,” their choir director said.  Future plans for this ensemble include performing at the annual Penryn Expo at i’langa Mall and the Christmas carol event at the school in December. The choir would like to do more public performances and bring their music to some of the local retirement homes in the vicinity.
