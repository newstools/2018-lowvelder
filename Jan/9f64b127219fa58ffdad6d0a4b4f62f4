 NKOMAZI – The husband of the deputy chief whip of the ANC in the National Assembly was arrested for perjury on Monday. Vusi Dlakude (49), the husband of Dorries Eunice Dlakude who has been a member of parliament since 2010, appeared in the Nkomazi Magistrate’s Court on Tuesday. Police spokesman Brig Leonard Hlathi said his appearance related to information which was received by the SAPS that Vusi was allegedly kidnapped by three armed men who redirected him to Hectorspruit while he was en route to Hhoyi Trust.
