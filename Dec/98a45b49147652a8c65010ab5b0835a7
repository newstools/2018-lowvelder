 SKUKUZA – For Paul Shabangu and Deliwe Sambo, their experience of the Kruger National Park (KNP) changed forever on Tuesday December 4. In future, they and other people with disabilities necessitating wheelchairs to get along can also go on game drives with their families. And better still, it can all happen in the comfort of their own chairs. Specially adapted game drive vehicles that can accommodate tourists with mobility challenges were introduced in the KNP on that day, and Shabangu and Sambo were the first guests to be taken on a short drive. Four adapted 14-seater activity vehicles now form part of the KNP visitor management plan and more could be introduced in future. Weights of up to a maximum of 250 kilograms can be hoisted onto the vehicles, so wheelchair-bound visitors will be able to enjoy a game drive in their own chairs, safely tied to the vehicle by a set of specially designed safety belts. Each vehicle costs more than R700 000. Eight seats of a normally 22-seater were sacrificed to make room for wheelchairs. The hoist is easy to operate and guides will receive training in its use. During the launch ceremony Marula general manager, Lucy Nhlapo said in her address that this is but one way KNP gives greater access to more people. Piet van Wyk, manager of fleet services in the KNP, explained the technicalities of the mobility-challenged activity vehicles before the two special guests got a taste of what other mobility challenged visitors may experience in future. The vehicles will be stationed at major camps and when booking game drives, guests will be asked whether this facility is needed.
