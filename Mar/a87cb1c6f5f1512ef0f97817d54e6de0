 BUSHBUCKRIDGE – A 36 year-old woman was allegedly raped after she stopped her car to help someone she thought was in trouble.  According to Brig Leonard Hlathi, the incident took place on Wednesday at around 17:30 on the road between Lydenburg and Bushbuckridge. “The woman was driving home when a half-naked lady emerged from the bushes and waved her down acting like she needed help. First the woman drove on, then decided to drive back and help the lady. As soon as she stopped her vehicle the half naked lady vanished and a man came out of the bushes wearing a balaclava. He pointed a firearm at her.” He got into the vehicle next to her and instructed her to drive towards Injaka dam.  They stopped the vehicle in a remote area. The man then contacted his friend who joined them.  “The woman tried to escape but the suspect fired a shot. Then he forced her to undress and him and his accomplice took turns raping her.” They further robbed the woman of an undisclosed amount of money, a cellphone and other belongings, then fled the scene in a green Volkswagen Citi Golf. No one has been arrested as yet and police are on the lookout for the suspects including the lady who appeared to be asking for assistance. Lt Gen Mondli Zuma urged motorists to be wary of people who seek help along the road. Anyone with information that could lead to their arrest is urged to call Constable Dolly Marule at 072 969 1985 or the SAPS Crime Stop number 08600 10111.
