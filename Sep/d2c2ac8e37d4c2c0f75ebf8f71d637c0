I was so glad when they brought us the shoes,” Mangwengoe said. He started the team because he wanted children to be a part of something bigger. “If they do not participate in sport, they end up using drugs and we wanted to get them away from that. All the shoes that were donated. “We are also developing them to one day hopefully play in the big leagues,” he said and added that they are already focusing on developing young talent. The children brought the shoes to school on September 13. It coincided with St Peter’s Barefoot Day, where children came to school without shoes and then donated a pair to under-resourced Catholic schools. According to Jacques Janse van Rensburg, principal of the school, apart from the soccer boots they raised 354 pairs of shoes.
