MBOMBELA – Feral cats are a major problem in the city. That is why Nelspruit SPCA launched a project to help these creatures.
Ludi Botha, SPCA vice-chairman of the board, explained that the SPCA feeds and also sterilises feral cats. “We then put them back in their natural habitat to fend off snakes and rats.” Also read: Nelspruit SPCA may have to close its doors in the very near future The food supply for this project is low and all donations are welcome.”Our own animals are our priority, but we want to protect the neglected feral cats as well.” See below the current status of food supplies at the SPCA
