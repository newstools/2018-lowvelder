 The High Court has ruled against an interdict by the University of Mpumalanga (UMP) which instructed students to vacate the campus. UMP sent out a statement to inform students about an early recess and instructing them to vacate campus by 12:00 on August 27. The students approached the court, disputing the interdict. The court ruled that they are allowed to stay on campus, even though they will not be attending classes. The dean of students, Dr Paul Maminza, confirmed that students were granted permission to stay by the court.

We had previously approached the court to get an interdict that stops them from protesting. The judge said if we had gone back after we saw what was happening, he would have then made a decision on the matter.” ALSO READ: Students boycott classes at university Last week the university suspended two members of the SRC, the president, Mcolisi Ngcamphalala and the treasurer, Wandile Shabangu. According to Shabangu, the court allowed the students to stay because they argued the basis of the interdict. “Things were not the way they claimed we explained to the court. The judge also saw that after they submitted their first interdict to us they did not follow up with a notice of motion before suspending us,” he said.
