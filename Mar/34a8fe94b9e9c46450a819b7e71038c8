MBOMBELA – An accident involving a single vehicle happened at the ring road on the N4 early this morning.  “We can confirm that the car rolled and that two people have died,” said TRAC spokesman Solange Soares-Nicholson. One person sustained serious injuries while three others were only slightly injured.  Mmusi Moeti, Mbombela municipality spokesman for community safety, security and liaison, said at this stage they were not absolutely certain what had caused the accident.  “Early indicators point to the driver losing control of the vehicle and we suspect that high speed might have played a factor.”  TRAC has confirmed that the road is open and safe for motorists.
