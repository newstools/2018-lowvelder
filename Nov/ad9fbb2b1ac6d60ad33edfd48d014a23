 With the festive season on our doorstep, the excitement of getting ready to go on leave and travel your routes to your holiday destination, we all have one lingering thought. Which traffic fines could I receive? Will I be stopped for anything that is wrong with my vehicle?  Nothing can spoil your holiday buzz like worrying about receiving a traffic fine – after all, we are human, we make mistakes. Lowvelder has the answer: here’s how to prepare yourself, to help you worry a little less. Every person in the vehicle must wear a safety belt. A fine of R500 will be issued for anyone in the car not using one. For each tyre that is run down or damaged in any way, you will be fined R500 per tyre.  For any damage on the windscreen, a fine of R750 can be issued. Skipping a red traffic light is highly frowned upon and will set you back a hefty R2 000.  Crossing or overtaking where the barrier line is solid is strictly forbidden and will result in a R2 000 fine. Driving with an expired driver’s licence or failure to produce a valid one when stopped by a traffic officer will be cause for a R2 000 fine – on the spot. Driving with an expired PDP or failure to produce a valid PDP will result in a fine of R3 000.  Speeding fines depend on several different points such as the area you are travelling in, the speed limit, how fast over the speed limit you are travelling. The average speed fine starts at R500. If you have a licence disk on your car but it is expired you are looking at a R750 fine, but if you don’t have a licence disk on your vehicle at all, you are looking at a steep fine of R3 000. Skipping a stop street or stopping over the line at a stop street will cost you R2 000. Traffic offences that will get you arrested on the spot.
