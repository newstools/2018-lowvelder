 Not everyone is fortunate enough to have a warm blanket, clothes or food. On a quest to make a difference to those who are less privileged, Round Table Crocodile 205 and Toyota Southern Africa have partnered in a joint blanket drive venture, known as FightingCold and going by the hashtag #iamawinterknight. It was launched on June 1 and will come to a close during mid-July. Round Table Crocodile 205 is a non-political, non-denominational group of men aged 18 to 40.  They embrace and develop fellowship among young men through the medium of their professional and business occupations in the form of meetings, lectures, discussions and other activities. They are organised under the Round Table Southern Africa. Winter Knights is a home-grown and hands-on Round Table SA project that encompasses a campaign in aid of those less fortunate during the cold winter months by collecting blankets, clothes and non-perishable foodstuffs. This one of the many nationwide projects by Round Table and Toyota SA. Locals can make their contributions to this initiative at collection bins placed at Imperial Toyota Nelspruit and Malelane Toyota. You can drop off the blankets at the two car dealers, and if you love photos, you can also take a selfie to share on the social pages. You can find them on Facebook at fb.com/rtcroc205 and Instagram on instagram.com/rtcroc205. All the proceeds raised will be donated to GRIP in Mbombela. This is an intervention programme for victims of abusive relationships and rape. It was established in 2010 as an extension of the care rooms and court intervention. The purpose is to provide short-term or temporary accommodation for abused women and their children. Bongani Mtimkhulu from Round Table Crocodile 205, said they chose GRIP because a majority of the perpetrators of violence against women and children are young men. “We want to mitigate this through this initiative,” he explained.
