We are also certain that he means no harm.” According to a well-known local blogger, street artist, and previously convicted graffiti artist who wishes to remain anonymous, they work under extremely difficult circumstances, as they have to avoid being caught in the act. “Graffiti artists have different styles and approaches, but they all share one thing in common – their art leaves a lasting impression. It is clearly evident that this man is trying to make a point,” he said. Human concluded by saying at this stage, the graffiti art will not be removed and they are still looking for clues.
