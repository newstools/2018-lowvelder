 MBOMBELA – Last week the SAPS exhumed the body of Thandi Zitha (55). An autopsy was conducted soon afterwards. She was found dead at a residence in the estate on October 1. Her family and the EFF opened a case of murder against her former employer.
Police spokesman, Brig Leonard Hlathi said police could not confirm the cause of death as yet because they had not received the results yet. Zitha lived in Alexander in Bushbuckridge and had two children and two grandchildren who she supported. Hi-Tech Medical Services operations manager, Freek Esterhuizen said he was called out to the house on the day Zitha’s body was discovered. “She was lying in a passage at the back of the house near the toilet.” Esterhuizen said he had certified the death due to natural causes. “I suspected it was a heart attack.” He said the family had been away for the weekend and only discovered her body when they got back.
