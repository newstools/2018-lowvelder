 In 2015 Louise de Klerk launched Timbali Technology Incubator. Now she is celebrating more than 30 women from Mbombela who were formerly farm workers or unemployed and are now farmers and employers. The incubator is funded by STP (SEDA Technology Programme), which facilitates the development of business-technology incubators in South Africa. The land used to farm is located in Friedenheim. “We want to have women be the farmers and share in the profit. We don’t just teach them to farm, but give them the opportunity to learn more about all the facets of farming, like packing, supply chains and finances,” De Klerk said. Through the incubator they have built brands under which the farmers can sell their produce. Two of the biggest brands are amaVeg and amaFruit. These are so successful that they have become regular suppliers for Shoprite – which has supported the project a great deal.

They produce over 5,5 million flowers a year,” De Klerk explains. An impressive 100 per cent of Timbali’s farmers make it through the first year of business as the business focuses on providing them with the necessary skills and education to effectively run a business. Tons of success stories have seen the light due to this programme. “Usually when you get taught you don’t get paid,” said Nelisiwe Mashabane, who became a farmer through the project, “but here I am. I am able to pay my bills and provide for my family.” De Klerk is very proud of what this initiative does for women, especially those who are the sole providers for their families. “I have seen them learn and grow so much in a very short time and I am excited to build a sustainable future with them.” READ ALSO: Lowveld’s most-beautiful flower blooms for fest
