 MBOMBELA – The engines were revving and the party was in full swing at the sixth annual Dogs on the Run: Bikers Against Poaching event on Saturday and Sunday. The event was held at Kwanyoni Lodge. On both evenings riders and other guests were treated to a buffet as well as live music from Voodoo Kudu, Goat n Hare and Monkey Queen.  Sean and Amanda Bushney with Grant and Chantel de Jager. On Saturday the bikers went to a sanctuary to visit rhinos that were orphaned when their mothers were killed by poachers. “We started the project because we really love rhinos and we wanted to do what we could to save the rhino population for the generations to come,” said Bernadette Woodford, organiser and one of the founder members of the event. Johan Schnettler and his wife Elmarie also participated in the event.
“This is the first year we rode the full route on both days and we enjoyed it very much. It is our way to help protect the rhino legacy for future generations.” On Sunday evening a prize-giving was held to honour the bikers who participated in the event. The first entry prize went to the Hell Razors Bike Club and the biggest club award went to Dynamic Dunamis.  Marina and Marius Vorster with Chanel Schutte and Izak Naudè.
