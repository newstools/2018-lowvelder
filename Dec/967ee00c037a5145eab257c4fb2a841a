The bill will be in effect from the 1st of January 2019, stating that all employees must be paid at minimum of R20 per hour across the board. The minimum rate will be adjusted annually. Employers unable to afford the wage, may apply for exemption. Domestic workers and farm workers are excluded from the initial phasing in of the R20 hourly rate, a date is yet to be fixed for the implementation of the R20 hourly rate in these two sectors.
