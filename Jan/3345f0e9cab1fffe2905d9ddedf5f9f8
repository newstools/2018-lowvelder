The much anticipated Amorphophallus titanum flower attracted young and old admires to Afri Orchids on Sunday.
The so-called corpse flower took 10 years to bloom. The flower is expected to last for two days.  Once open it emits a stench like rotting flesh to attract pollinating insects.
By Sunday the unusual event had attracted nearly 1000 visitors.
