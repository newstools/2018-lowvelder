 MBOMBELA- A pedestrian was hit by oncoming traffic near the Alkmaar filling station last night. The incident occurred at about 19:30. Mmusi Moeti, Mpumalanga municipality spokesman for community safety, security and liaison, confirmed that the hit was fatal. “Oncoming traffic has right of way there and there is no stop sign for them. We believe that the pedestrian was under the influence of alcohol. The pedestrian was wearing a red shirt.” “The pedestrian was only hit by one vehicle. The driver of the vehicle stopped and phoned the emergency services,” Moeti confirmed. The road was closed after the accident but later reopened. Motorists who were travelling on the same road said that they saw the pedestrian earlier that evening and they too believe he was under the influence of alcohol as he kept swerving across the road with no regards for his own safety or the safety of the motorists. TRAC spokesman Solange Soares-Nicholson said that there were no other fatalities reported to date. “The roads have still been quiet this morning but we believe traffic is going to increase later on.”
