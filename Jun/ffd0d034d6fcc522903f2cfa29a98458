 One of the Lowveld’s oldest sports clubs, LVCC, again hosted its ever-so-popular seven-a-side hockey tournament on Saturday. It was the third since relocating to its new home at Penryn College.
According to the organiser, Janine Wheeler, though the turnout could have been a little bit better at this year’s superhero-themed event, it was a day jam-packed with fun and tough competition. “As far back as I can remember, LVCC has been hosting this day,” said Wheeler.
“It isn’t dying, it’s just badly injured and through this event, we aim to lift it off the ground again,” she added. “The game is shrinking in certain areas, exacerbated by competing interests, modern life, and lack of artificial surfaces at clubs, but with the AstroTurf at Penryn we are confident that we can revive the sport,” she said. As much as it is designed to have fun, the players gave it their all, but in the end, of all seven teams that entered, the Black Panthers scored the most points and took the spoils.
Teams were awarded three points for a win, and one point was given to each in the case of a draw. The Black Panthers used their enhanced speed and strength to win all seven games, bagging 21 points. Also read: Swimmers included in national training squad
