 WHITE RIVER – With more than 3 500 visitors to the street party, the town centre was abuzz with laughter, fun and cheer last Friday night. Shortly after a section of Chief Mgiyeni Khumalo Street was closed off at 17:00, stalls arose out of nowhere and partygoers arrived en masse. More than 25 trees sparkled with lights and almost 2 000 metres of bunting were used. Three participating shopping centres and three rocking restaurants opened their hearts and doors to visitors. About 13 more food stalls, one comfortable coffee lounge and a busy bar run by the Thirsty Bartender served refreshment, while a kiddies’ corner kept the younger ones entertained. At the 21 interesting market stalls, visitors could buy various gifts and admire some art at the exhibition in the art gallery. As darkness fell, 15 traditional dancers took to the streets, followed by two fiery dancers, a silly stilt-walking clown and a friendly Father Christmas.  A marimba band and flash mob entertained people in the streets, while five more splendid singers took to the
two stages. More than 900 tickets were sold for Matthew Mole’s performance on the Coca-Cola stage and he did not disappoint. Young and old lounged around and listened to him, while the more enthusiastic supporters never left the area in front of the stage.
