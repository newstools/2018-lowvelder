 Three men died and one was injured during three heavy calibre shoot-outs in the Kruger National Park this week. According to SANParks spokesmen, 12 suspected rhino poachers have been arrested the last week. This includes a policeman based at the Skukuza police station. On Friday, KNP Rangers arrested three suspects in possession of a heavy calibre hunting rifle, ammunition, poaching equipment and a fresh set of rhino horns. According to SANParks, one of the suspects – a recently retired Frelimo Commander – was in full camouflage uniform when arrested. Five more were tracked down with the help of the park’s K9 team the next day. One suspected poacher was killed during a shoot-out. During a contact on Sunday, one suspected poacher was killed and another wounded and arrested. A heavy calibre hunting rifle, ammunition, poaching equipment and two fresh rhino horns were recovered at the scene. At about the same time, other rangers were in a contact with three suspected poachers. Armed conflict followed. One suspect was shot dead and the other two made a run for it. A hunting rifle, poaching equipment and ammunition were recovered at the scene. The policeman was arrested on suspicion of involvement in rhino poaching. He is in custody and should appear in court within the next two days.  Reacting to these arrests, the Managing Executive of KNP Mr Glenn Phillips said it is incredibly encouraging to know that there are such dedicated teams of rangers who face this kind of pressure every day and continue to disrupt suspected poachers activities “We need to match the efforts of these gallant men and women in uniform outside of our parks if we are to make serious inroads against the criminal syndicates.  Along with this communities need to work with us in supplying information as young people are losing their freedom and lives because of the greed of a few highly corrupt and connected criminals” concluded Phillips.
