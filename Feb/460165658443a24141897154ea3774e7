 MBOMBELA – A special evening of dinner and dance on Valentine’s Day at the well-known A Bica Coffee Shop at the Belladonna Centre heralded the official launch of the Lowveld Ballroom and Latin Dance Social Club. Members in future will meet on a monthly basis to enjoy and revive the art of formal dancing. The enthusiasm and high attendance of the first event show that there is great interest, says convener Felicia Lemmer. The evening was marked by a well-planned playlist of dance music as well as some live entertainment, together with an excellent three-course meal served in honour of the old tradition when these events were held on a regular basis in the Lowveld. “There is no place in the city where we can go to dance and have dinner, so this was sorely needed,” says Lemmer. During the evening, couples showed off their skills by doing the tango, waltzing and swinging, among other classic dances. Local group, the Hummingbirds, entertained the audience by performing popular hits. Shan-Rich Lemmer also sang a few Frank Sinatra songs to set the mood. The club will hold its next function at Uplands Preparatory School on either March 23 or 24. The date and other details are to be confirmed closer to the time.
