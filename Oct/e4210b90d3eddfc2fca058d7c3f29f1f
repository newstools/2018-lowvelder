They are refusing to let vehicles enter and exit the hospital, although they allow ambulances to enter.    According to Lynette Mahamba, regional treasurer of NEHAWU in Ehlanzeni region, they are demanding that the CEO of the hospital’s suspension continues, that two members of NEHAWU’s letters of suspension be withdrawn and demanding that the nurses’ home must not be renovated at this point.   “We have raised several concerns about the CEO of the hospital.
