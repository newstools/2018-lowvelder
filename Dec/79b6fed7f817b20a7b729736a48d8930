 The Care Buddies had a very successful 2018, thanks in no small part to the generous support of the community. The volunteers celebrated a big year with a year-end luncheon at Bundu Lodge on December 4. Care Buddies have branches in Mbombela, White River, Barberton and Hoedspruit, and presently have 140 volunteers serving the elderly in their respective communities. Each volunteer is committed to an hour’s visit each week. Conservatively estimated, the Buddies have given 6 720 hours of love and care to 540 elderly citizens over 48 weeks in 2018.

White River is the oldest branch and is well established with all the structures in place. Every year all the events, of which there are many, are well organised. The Mbombela branch is bursting at the seams. They are overwhelmed by new homes going up and by the many oldies needing a little attention. Despite this they calmly do their visits and entertainment, while striving to grow the organisation. Their chairman, Meisie Barnard, has a clear vision and a firm hand on the pulse of activities.  Barberton does not have an old-age home but this does not stop the Buddies there from having an intimate relationship with all the old folk in their town. The Buddies know when a little extra help is needed and they willingly give it. ALSO READ:Care Buddies spread a spirit of giving Hoedspruit does not have an old-age home either. An old church has been restored so that the Buddies have a venue to entertain the elderly. Hoedspruit Buddies travel as far as Kampersrus and isolated farms to fetch their old folk. Care Buddies founder, Yvonne McHeath thanked all the sponsors. “We could not do what we do without you. The selfless effort of each and every Buddy is commended and we look forward to another successful year of companionship with the elderly communities in the Lowveld.”
