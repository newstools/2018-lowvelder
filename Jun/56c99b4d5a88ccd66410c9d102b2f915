MBOMBELA – Municipal spokesman, Joseph Ngala, confirmed that Matsafeni, West Acres, i’langa Mall and Nelsriver areas were experiencing load shedding. These areas are different to those in the load shedding schedules which were in use in 2015. “It is not the same stage one schedule we used to know,” Ngala confirmed. “They are talking about blocks and we don’t know what they mean. Should  we find out which areas are affected later today we will promptly warm our consumers.” The previous load shedding schedule, published by Lowvelder in 2015, is widely being circulated on social media and reported on in other media.
