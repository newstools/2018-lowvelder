 Provincial police spokesman, Brig Leonard Hlathi says criminals are willing to do anything to get money.
“A woman was killed for money in Kwa-Mhlanga. The robbers entered her home, demanded money and shot her. This shows just how much they are willing to do anything to get what they want. What’s more, a man was recently robbed of a large sum of money in Mbombela. He had just withdrawn money from the ATM,” he said. Hlathi strongly encouraged the community members to work closely with the police. “Our responsibility is to protect the public although some community members get angry when we stop them during road blocks. It is as if we are doing something wrong yet we are doing something right,” he added.

When doing your shopping, remember not to carry a large amount of money, use bank services that take money directly from your bank account then pay for your expenses without having to withdraw money. When using an ATM you must never ask for assistance from strangers,” Hlathi emphasised.
