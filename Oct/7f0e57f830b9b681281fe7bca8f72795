As a form of a cheap preventive measures for those without burglars on their doors and windows must place an empty bottle behind their doors so that when the would-be intruders open a door, it will fall and make a noise that will awake them,” said Ndubane. In the latest break-in, a single parent, Staff Nkosi, who resides in Extension 11 had her house cleaned on Monday evening by intruders. She said they didn’t hear the intruders when they gained entry. “We only woke-up at around 05:00 to find the door wide open. My child’s cellphone, a plasma screen television set, pairs of sneakers and clothes were stolen,” said Nkosi. She said the intruders gained entrance after opening a window and pulling the keys that were left hanging in the door. Nkosi said she opened a case of housebreaking with the Barberton SAPS and a team of forensic experts came to collect finger print evidence at her home. No arrest has been made yet.
