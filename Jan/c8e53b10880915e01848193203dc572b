According to Broodryk the vehicles were reported to the police as possibly having been involved in illegal activities. When members of the police spotted Shabangu and Vukeni travelling in the Polo, they pulled over the vehicle.
A search revealed two knives, a homemade silencer and live ammunition. The Polo was taken to the park’s Missions Area Joint Operations Centre (Majoc) headquarters. Members of the Kruger National Park’s protection services pulled over the minibus and took it to Majoc as well. According to a witness statement, police dogs “reacted positively to a rifle smell of the taxi”.

The case was postponed to yesterday and all four accused remained in custody over the weekend. At the time of publication, the outcome of their court appearance was not known.
