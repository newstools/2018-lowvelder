 The announcement represents one of the most significant moves by any carmaker to embrace electrification and highlights how, over a century after the invention of the ICE, electrification is paving the way for a new chapter in automotive history. “This is about the customer,” says Håkan Samuelsson, president and CEO. “People increasingly demand electrified cars and we want to respond to our customers’ current and future needs.  You can now pick and choose whichever electrified Volvo you wish.”First, it will launch five new fully electric cars between 2019 and 2021, three of which will be Volvo models and two of which will be high-performance electrified cars from Polestar, Volvo Cars’ performance brand.

This means that there will in future be no Volvo cars which do not feature an electric motor, as pure ICE cars are gradually phased out and replaced by ICE cars that are enhanced with electrified drivetrains. “This announcement marks the end of the solely combustion-engine-powered car,” continues Samuelsson. “Volvo Cars has stated that it plans to have sold a total of one million electrified cars by 2025.  When we said it, we meant it. This is how we are going to do it.”The announcement underlines Volvo Cars’ commitment to minimising its environmental impact and making the cities of the future cleaner.
