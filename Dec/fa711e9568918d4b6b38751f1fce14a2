 While you might be used to your usual gym and running routine at home, going away is a great opportunity to mix it up and try new workouts, from on-the-go videos to local classes and activities. A skipping rope weighs very little and doesn’t take up too much space (try packing it inside a shoe!), but skipping will help improve your fitness, flexibility, endurance, stamina and coordination. Ditch the bus or car and plan your sightseeing tour by foot or bike. You’ll get to see all the great sights while getting in a good workout, too. Whether you’re staying in a hotel or an apartment, there could be facilities available to use, such as a swimming pool or gym. If your place has a pool, pack your swimming goggles and bathing suit, and get in a few laps in the morning or evening. Oh, and one more thing – don’t forget to spend a little time relaxing. You are on holiday, after all.
