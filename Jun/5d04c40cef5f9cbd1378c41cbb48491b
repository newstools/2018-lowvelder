 While Eskom has not implemented rotational loadshedding this morning, there is still a possibility that loadshedding could be implemented from 5pm to 9pm today. Load shedding will only be implemented as a last resort once all other emergency reserves have been exhausted. Customers are encouraged to continue to use electricity sparingly. Please switch off geysers as well as all non-essential lighting and electricity appliances to assist in reducing demand. Should loadshedding be implemented this evening it would be for a period of up to four hours. Stage 1 loadshedding requires 1000MW to be loadshed nation-wide. Loadshedding is conducted as a measure of last resort to protect the power system from a total collapse or blackout. Also read: LOAD SHEDDING SCHEDULE Customers are advised to keep checking the loadshedding schedules on the Eskom and the municipal website, and plan on the assumption that loadshedding will take place. In the event that loadshedding becomes necessary, Eskom and the municipalities will use the published rotational loadshedding schedules. For Eskom customers, these schedules are available on the Eskom website (http://loadshedding.eskom.co.za). Eskom customers can also contact our customer contact centre at 0860 037 566. Eskom will provide regular updates on the status of the power system through all media platforms.
