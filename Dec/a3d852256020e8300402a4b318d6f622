 On top of four exterior paint choices, the exterior of the 300 SPORT features a selection of model-specific enhancements such as a dark satin grey finish for the grille and window surrounds, side sills and vents, rear valance, mirror caps and boot spoiler.  Alloy wheel choices include 19- and 20-inch options, also with dark satin grey finishes, while special, black brake calipers get 300 SPORT branding.

The rear-wheel drive 300 SPORT features Jaguar Land Rover’s 221kW/400Nm 2,0-litre four-cylinder Ingenium petrol engine and an 8-speed automatic transmission. The combination means the XE can accelerate from 0-100km/h in just 5,7 seconds. Standard on all Jaguar XE models, including the 300 SPORT, torque vectoring by braking helps to maximise control through corners by providing controlled independent braking on the individual inside front and rear wheels.

Also standard on all XEs, all-surface progress control is a low-speed cruise control that helps with low-traction situations in all weather conditions, so that drivers can concentrate on steering, while JaguarDrive Control allows drivers to select various drive modes at the touch of a finger.  Settings range from dynamic, with faster gear shifts and sportier kick-downs, to Eco, with earlier upshifts and more efficient transmission programmes.  The XE 300 SPORT is available in South Africa now, priced from R792 800 including VAT but excluding CO2 charges.
