The Mbombela Licensing Department offices at The Grove in Riverside Park are offline. They have been so for a while. A concerned citizen member said he went to the offices on several different occasion over the past three weeks with no luck. According to him, he was very happy when they opened the new office but he said it seems as if the office is not doing the public any justice.

As a taxpayer who is doing my part it is a huge inconvenience to go there then find a notice stating that they are closed. It is a waste of petrol and time. I do my best to make sure that I renew everything before it expires. My caravan disc expires on December 31 and I want to make sure that I renew it in advance. I am aware of the three weeks’ grace period after it expires, however, I prefer to do everything on time.” The public was advised to go to the office in town, however, due to it being the only operational office at the moment the number of people who need services is too high. “It is very hot, there are a lot of people waiting for service and there is no parking space. I want the municipality to be aware that there’s a problem and they need to fix it. When we had load-shedding we could understand, but not now,” he explained. A week ago both the offices were offline due to load-shedding. City of Mbombela Local Municipality (CMLM) spokesman, Joseph Ngala said they are aware that the offices have been offline for a while. Ngala said there is a problem with Telkom’s national software. “Due to the problem they cannot renew their driver’s licences and car licence discs. The workers cannot log on to the system and if they do it takes very long to log on which affects everything,” he said. Ngala said he will investigate further to find out if the situation is still the same.
