 For the next 41 days, Dave Busschau, also known as Crazy Dave, will not have the luxury of his comfortable bed as he embarks on an adventure to run 1 900 kilometres. Crazy Dave put his best foot forward for charity on Saturday morning when he left the city for Cape Town, all in aid for underprivileged runners and the SPCA. “I’m turning 50 this year. I have decided to celebrate my birthday by giving back to the community. I love running, I love my country and when you run you create positive energy for everyone around you,” he said.  Crazy Dave has been running for more than 20 years. In his long career, he completed the Comrades Marathon on many occasions. In 2004 he also ran from Mbombela to Durban. “I’m planning to do 40 to 50 kilometres per day and I hope after 45 days I will be on top of Table Mountain.”  To show their support, Nelspruit Marathon Club sent Crazy Dave off on his journey with a prayer on Saturday before the members ran the first stretch with him. Here is a day to day breakdown of his journey so far:  Also read: Five ways to celebrate Arbor Week
