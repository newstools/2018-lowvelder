The cable supplied the town with electricity. The power was finally restored at around 16:00 on Friday. Most businesses in town have to resort to the use of generators as an alternative to keep operating as normal. Landsberg said it cost the council a lot of money to replace stolen cables. He urged the residents to report the cable theft suspects. Residents can phone 013-712-2222.
