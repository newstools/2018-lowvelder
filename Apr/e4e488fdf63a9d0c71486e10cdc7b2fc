 With an electrifying sound and the deep, pulsating beat of drums, Church Unlimited came alive when Grand Traverse took to the stage on Friday.  Grand Traverse is a Christian contemporary act, with a rock influence and sound. The band hails from sunny Durban and are currently busy cutting their debut CD. The usual gatherings at Church Unlimited ensued early on Friday evening, with coffee or tea, snacks and friends getting together to catch up on the week’s events, groups of people laughing and kids full of the joys of life chasing one another around the lawn and bouncing delightedly on the jumping castle. Mpilo Makhubela and Shannon Frank. By the time Grand Traverse came on, almost everyone was waiting in the hall in anticipation, and they were not disappointed. With the hiss of the smoke machine, the lead singer addressed the crowd. With strobe lights flashing every colour of the rainbow the audience erupted into a mass of joy, stomping their feet and swaying to the beat of a band well versed in crowd pleasing. The band visited Mbombela to drive awareness for the upcoming Ground Swell Camp, which is to be held during the school holidays.  Fifteen-minute gigs have whetted the appetite of many a fan, and Friday’s gig was a real treat, going on for an hour. The enraptured audience was lost in the expert musical ability of the drummer and guitarist, while the deep and melodious voice of the lead lent soul and depth.
