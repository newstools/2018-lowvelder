We commonly referred to gesiggies.   “Smoking”  Nothing tastes like Fresca.  This used to get me into a lot of trouble.  The frustration of removing that pesky piece of wax paper. Google in the 90’s. How to steal a girl’s heart in primary school .  A Pritt spider web.  Who still enjoys a Coke float every now and then.  You know you are a South African when of these were in your kitchen.
