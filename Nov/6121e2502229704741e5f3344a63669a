MBOMBELA – According to eyewitnesses, the male staff member was held up by a man just before he got to Nedbank. “They took his wallet and the bag. We are afraid they were watching their store and when they made the deposit,” said the witness. “The victim was shaken up badly by this and is afraid, as they took his wallet with his details.” According to Hi-Tech Security Lowveld operations manager, Callum MacPherson, there were three men that were involved in the robbery. “Our footage showed that a blue BMW was parked near him. The suspects got into vehicle and drove away. There were no number plates on it.” Crossing Centre managment stated they were unable to comment at this stage.
