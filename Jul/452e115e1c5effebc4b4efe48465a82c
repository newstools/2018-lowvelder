 MBOMBELA – This year’s dry season has officially started, and the region’s dam levels are in a downward spiral. The Inkomati Usuthu Catchment Management Agency (IUCMA) recently met with its water users (Crocodile River Operations Committee) to look at the upcoming dry winter months. The Crocodile Catchment received below normal rainfall distribution across the catchment in December 2017 and January 2018, hence the low inflow into Kwena Dam during the last wet summer season. Kwena Dam was at 65 per cent in October 2017, increased to 74 per cent by end of May. If compared to October 2016, Kwena Dam was 26 per cent and it increased to 75 per cent by end of May 2017. READ ALSO: Dam levels show slight increase The low inflow into the Kwena and Inyaka dams during the last summer season will affect the water resource availability of the Crocodile and Sabie River Catchments during the next few winter months. These dams continue to be in the moderately low zone. Therefore users should continue to use water wisely throughout the dry season. The IUCMA hydrological planning models predict that there is a high possibility of irrigation water use restrictions over the next months in the Crocodile and Sabie Sand River Catchment, especially from August to September. The outlook for the Usuthu and Komati River Catchment is positive, with most dams’ storage in the systems currently above normal.Currently, the river flow levels in all the main rivers (Crocodile, Sabie, Komati, and Usuthu Rivers) and their tributaries are slightly above average. READ ALSO: How the recent rain affected dam levels This is due to the high groundwater baseflow levels and less irrigation water requirements from the irrigators. Moving into the dry months, the baseflow contributions will decrease and more water will be released from the upstream dams. Currently 1,0 cubic metres per second and 0,5 cubic metres per second are released from Kwena Dam and Inyaka Dam respectively. Dam levels (percentages) at present
• Da Gama Dam 84,7
• Driekoppies Dam 68,3
• Heyshope Dam 88,9
• Inyaka Dam 78,3
• Jericho Dam 88,0

According to the latest South African Water Services Seasonal Climate Watch report for June 2018 to October 2018, the El Niño-Southern Oscillation has now moved into the neutral phase and is expected to rise towards an El Niño phase through winter and spring. At this stage there is a high likelihood of an El Niño developing.

Generally warmer temperatures are expected across the country during mid and late winter.
