Their recipe for success was simple. Serve up an unrivalled dining experience that revolved around their love of great steak and their exceptional taste in wines. Since then 41 years have passed, and even though there are now 20 Turn ‘n Tender restaurants across the country and the legend has grown beyond our borders with a  restaurant in Zambia, little has changed as far the original recipe is concerned. Take a seat at a table in any Turn ‘n Tender and you’ll experience a stylish and sophisticated atmosphere, ideal for all those special occasions and everyday celebrations. Every waiter is extremely knowledgeable when comes to the wine list and the different cuts and you can rest assured that your steak will be prepared just the way you like it. There is even a specialty drinks menu, which gets updated every 3 months, that has featured some of the finest whiskies and bespoke gins from around the world.  The highlight of the menu, however, is undoubtedly the page that lists the four brothers’ specials. Here each brother’s favourite dish has been paired with the perfect wine and you can taste the proud heritage on which the legend has been built. What is certain is that Turn ‘n Tender offers an unmatched dining experience that you’ll remember long after the evening is over. What started off as a story about four brothers has turned into a legend. What started off as a steakhouse has turned into a dining experience that carries the Mark of Legend.
