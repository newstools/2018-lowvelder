 MBOMBELA – The fixing of the first 1 050 houses which were severely damaged in a hailstorm in May is set to be completed by the end of the month, but it is still unclear where the funds for this will come from. Department of Human Settlements spokesman, Freddy Ngobe reiterated their commitment to this deadline on Friday, after Premier Refilwe Mthsweni made the same commitment on October 12. Following violent protests in August, the premier declared it a disaster area.
