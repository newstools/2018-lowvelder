 WHITE RIVER – The exhibition for this year’s Chicken Challenge officially opened at the White River Gallery at Casterbridge Lifestyle Centre on Tuesday night. This will give the public the opportunity to see the creativity and amazing designs for this year’s popular auction.The annual Chicken Challenge is a fun and thoughtful way to raise funds for GRIP.  The non-profit organisation helps thousands of survivors of rape and domestic abuse. It depends entirely on donated funds and fund-raising initiatives. The chickens have managed to bring people from different backgrounds together in an effort to make a difference. A team from Siyabonga Crafters make the 3D canvases, which are then sold to participants. They then decorate them in any way they choose and hand them back to be auctioned.

Hilton Barnett, from We Are White River, said more than 80 people have registered. “The response from the public has been great and this is a great start.”
Each of the chickens is decorated in their own unique themes and styles. The exhibition is open for the public to view the chickens until June 16.  At the opening guests participated in a mini live auction and enjoyed snacks and drinks while wandering through the display of different artworks created for the initiative. The two chickens auctioned fetched R2 300 and R2 000. Reinette Fourie, the founder of the Chicken Challenge initiative with Karin Daymond and Marlize Meyer, said the number of participants has grown in past years.
