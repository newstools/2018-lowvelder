 “The name says it all,” says owner of the recently opened Quick Lane in Mbombela, Greg Gulle. “It’s about offering customers a quick, professional and 100% workmanship first-time-round service – oil and filter changes, tyre rotation and brake inspection, top-up fluids, battery tests, belts and hoses while allowing for greater personal interaction with customers.”  Quick Lane has 1 200 stores around the world and this Mbombela store is the fifth in South Africa. The initiative comes from Ford in the States, so you need to be a Ford dealership owner to own one of these Quick Lane stores. This shop is quite large and the reception area presents one with an open-plan design, lots of light and user-friendly colour schemes which I think, will immediately remove the emotional grudge experience from buying tyres and/or minor vehicle inspections.  “We will, irrespective of the service you require, do a full inspection of your vehicle (gratis/pasella/no charge/nix). The purpose of this is to assist and improve your preventative methodologies. So, our model is one of a premium service at affordable prices. This concept also supports the Right to Warranty initiative.  The short explanation of this is that you can access services outside of the place of purchase meaning that you can buy X vehicle and then get it serviced at a Quick Lane where the equipment as well as the technicians are fully trained and accredited.  “In terms of time, we are looking at services which can be completed within 30 minutes to two hours maximum.” So, dear reader, if your vehicle is due for some preventative TLC and more, you should perhaps introduce it to the welcoming environment of Quick Lane in Riverside. But be warned – addiction is guaranteed.
