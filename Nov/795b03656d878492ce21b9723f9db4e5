 MBOMBELA –  Police spokesman, Capt Zandile Gqawa said SAPS are still investigating the stabbing and assault of Christina Visagie (69). On the morning of the attack, Visagie was sleeping when she heard noises coming from outside, so she went to check. Gqawa said Visagie saw two unknown men outside the house. They broke down the door and punched her in the face, knocking her down. The suspects then stabbed her repeatedly in her shoulder and one of her arms. Gqawa said the suspects stole her cellphone and tablet and then fled the scene.
Hi-Tech Security medical services paramedic, Tristan van Huyssteen, said they treated her for lacerations on the scene. “They hit her in the face with their fists. They also hit her with a chair.” She was transported to Rob Ferreira Hospital. Family members have confirmed that Visagie is out of hospital and recovering. AfriForum Lowveld’s district coordinator, Hennie Bekker, pointed out that while a farm attack was defined by police as an attack on farms and smallholdings, which refers to acts aimed at residents, workers and visitors to farms and smallholdings, there is no actual “farm attack” legal offence. “The police have a code that they use to keep track of when attacks happen in rural areas,” he explained.
