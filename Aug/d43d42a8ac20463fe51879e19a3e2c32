 PILGRIM’S REST – No less than ten lease agreements for businesses in this town were granted yesterday.
These are for businesses that are already operational and many premises still currently stand vacant. These lease agreements will be for a period of 10 years. Notifications for the following operations to continue or to start up business, were sent out by the Mpumalanga Department of Public Works, Roads and Transport.
• Kuzzulos Emporium, currently operational
• Berettas
• Mona Cottage, currently operated by Mike Goodwin
• The Olde Print Shop
• Chaitows.

This restaurant has since lost its liquor licence. “One can only hope that government will now assist in rectifying this matter,” said Duncan Ballantyne, chairman of Mpumalanga Heritage. Mpumalanga Heritage is a registered civics organisation for the conservation of all aspects of heritage and history in the province.
Another challenge is the Highwayman’s Garage, which with Clewer General Dealer was awarded to a new applicant. The ruined and neglected Pilgrim’s Rest caravan and camping site, once one of the best of its kind in the country. This service station, which is supposed to render an essential service to the community, has been standing empty for the past few years. The general dealer that used to serve the community as a grocer has also dwindled down to the basic essentials. Scott’s Café and The Royal Bottle Store, both standing empty for many years now, have also been granted to a new, unidentified operator.
Public pressure; driven by community leaders, business operators, Mpumalanga Heritage and the media; has recently forced the MEC for Public Works, Roads and Transport, Gillion Mashego, to fast-track the finalisation of proper economically viable lease agreements. This was after this important local tourism destination was practically brought to its knees economically, due to the province’s lack of proper governance and indecisiveness about the future of this public asset. Scott’s Café, a once-popular restaurant standing empty for many years, is to reopen soon. Though not confirmed, the future operation of the ruined, derelict and defunct caravan park as well as the run-down Beretta’s Guest House was awarded to The Mpumalanga Regional Training Trust (MRTT), a registered Section 21 company financed by government. It is the same organisation currently operating the Royal Hotel and several accommodation annexes in town.
