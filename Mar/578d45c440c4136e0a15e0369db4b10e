 KAAPSEHOOP – A speeding motorist was not “concentrating” when he hit and killed one of the famed wild horses this weekend. The horse’s carcass, one of the few mares left around town, was discovered by an unknown motorist at around 07:00 on the morning following the incident. Jan Henning, one of the residents who has vowed to take care of the horses, was alerted by the motorist. He went to the scene and along with other concerned citizens, moved the carcass to the side of the road. The next day the perpetrator’s guilty conscience got the better of him and apologised to Henning for leaving the mare. He explained that the accident occurred around 23:00 on Saturday, when he was on his way back from Ngodwana to Mbombela. He admitted to driving at a high speed with his Toyota Land Cruiser and lacking concentration when it suddenly appeared in front of him. Ten-metre-long skid marks proved that he tried to avoid the collision, but due to his speed he could not avoid hitting the horse. He further explained that he left the scene because he was in shock. “This when all evidence suggests that the mare was alive for hours after the incident,” said Henning. Reinette van Niekerk of Kaapsehoop Wild Horse Rescue said the number of mares had just started to pick up. “Half of the horse population like spending time next to the road due to motorists feeding them from their cars. This not only poses a danger for colic, but lures the horses to the road, making them used to vehicles and creating a risk for accidents,” said Van Niekerk.
