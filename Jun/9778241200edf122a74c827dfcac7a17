 Local and national artists showcased their creativity in a colourful display of designs. As much as the awards were about craft, guests also dressed to kill. This year there was over 1 000 entrants, a 20 per cent increase on 2017. “Looking at the number of people who sent their entries this year, it shows there is a great interest from the craft industry. When we incorporated the competition into the annual Innibos festival, it was to give the artists in the country a platform to show us their talents,” said Sandra Jacobs from Innibos. The MEC for sport, arts and culture, Thandi Shongwe, when she officially opened the event, said Innibos contributed a lot to the gross domestic product of the province.

I met with the safety MEC and he has assured me that everyone will be safe,” said Shongwe.
The competition was about creativity. All the participants needed to do was simply take a photo of their entry, next to a matchbox for scale and either email it or send it via MMS or WhatsApp.
Sixty entries were shortlisted and will form part of an exhibition being held at the civic centre from June 24 to 30.
The winner of the platinum award received R50 000. The gold award winner took home R20 000 and the silver R15 000. The first prize went to Solly Monyela who are from Tzaneen, Limpopo.
“It took us two days to design the artwork. It is the first time have we won so much money. A platform like this one is appreciated. It is the place where emerging artists get the opportunity to test our skills,” said Monyela. The gold award went to Phumlani Nyawo.
