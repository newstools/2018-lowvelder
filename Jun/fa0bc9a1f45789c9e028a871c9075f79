 People, and for that matter, life can be compared to an onion. We are all layered and once one peels one layer, there is always another. His bold and straight-down-the-line approach to life and business may very well fail your first impression. But once past the first layer, one is introduced to his passion not just for the Mazda brand, but also his philosophical and emotional approach to what he refers to as everyone’s responsibility to live the “I am my brother’s keeper” life. Brannon grew up in the Vaal Triangle, and comes from a family with a strict approach to unquestionable moral values. “I have made some serious mistakes in my life though. I’ve been around the block. I have worked in the furniture business, washed cars, worked in a casino and have no quarrel with rolling up my sleeves and or sharing space with the less fortunate.

So, you just watch this space! Please visit the dealership and allow us to introduce you to luxury tailored for the ordinary and the extraordinary alike.” And with this my dear reader, we concluded a straight-down-the-line but delightful interview and introduction.
