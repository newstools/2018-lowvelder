 NKOMAZI – According to police spokesman, Col Mtsholi Bhembe, on Sunday the two men, who were in possession of a firearm, entered the restaurant around 18:00. “They demanded money and cellphones from staff members. However, members of the SANDF, who were in the vicinity, were alerted by a community member of the burglary in progress.” Their quick response forced the burglars back into the shop. The suspects started shooting at the SANDF members and in the process, the soldiers summoned backup from the police and the nearby army base. “The area was cordoned off and the suspects hid in the ceiling.” They continued shooting from their hiding place. Police, as well as army members, fired back. The suspects fell from the ceiling into a furniture shop next to the restaurant. They were certified dead at the scene by paramedics. A firearm with live rounds was recovered. No other injuries were reported. “The Independent Police Investigative Directorate was informed, and it will conduct its own investigation.” The provincial police commissioner, Lt Gen Mondli Zuma, commended the collaboration between the SANDF and SAPS members.
