 MBOMBELA – The Lowveld Aero Club (LAC), one of the oldest continuous clubs in the country, held its Wings & Solo annual event at the Old Nelspruit Airport on Saturday. Werner van der Merwe, LAC instructor, said their club has a rich history in the Lowveld. It has a flight school, which forms an integral part of the fabric of aviation in the region. He said the Wings & Solo event was combined with flying activities earlier in the day.  “Twelve aircraft participated in the event, which consisted of a short field take-off, a spot landing (trying to land as close as possible to a mark on the runway) and a short field landing,” he said. The flights were followed by the annual awards ceremony. The flying activity was held in fairly windy conditions, which led to a spectacular display of skill from the pilots.
