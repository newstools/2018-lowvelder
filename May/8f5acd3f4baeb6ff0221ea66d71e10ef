 MBOMBELA – The special blood drive was organised by the local donor committee of the South African National Blood Service (SANBS), which wants to make blood donation a big part of a South African culture. The committee worked tirelessly to encourage more people to assist SANBS in sustaining its much-needed supply.
The campaign included well-known community members who were “arrested”; they needed at least 10 people to donate before they could be released. The likes of Past TJ Maré who is KLCBT chairman, editor at Lowvelder, De Wet Potgieter, Sir Africa 2017, Rodney Haywood, general manager at Occupational Health and Safety Institute of South Africa, Bok van Rooy, president of the Lions Club of Nelspruit, Gerry van Gelder, and Frikkie Moolman from Fdesign Jewellery in Mbombela were among the prisoners. According to chairman of the committee Yolande Nel, the SANBS stated over the weekend that there was currently only two days’ worth of blood in stock.
“We want to help not only people who have been involved in car accidents, this blood is also used to help people who have cancer, premature babies and for mothers who give birth,” she explained. A recorded 128 units were donated. SANBS said each unit collected is tested for syphilis, hepatitis B and C and HIV using highly sophisticated machines.
“This is the reason why blood in South Africa is the safest in the world. Another good thing is that most people who donate are doing it voluntarily, unlike in other countries where they get paid for donating,” said Nel.
A unit of blood only lasts 42 days and for this reason, it is important for people to donate regularly. Donors can give blood as often as every eight weeks.
