 SKUKUZA – South African National Parks (SANParks) today announced the arrest of 23 suspected rhino poachers in the Kruger National Park (KNP) since July 19 this year. This was on the same day the Rangers Corps lost a colleague in a contact with a poaching group. Respect Mathebula became the second Ranger casualty since 1958 involving a poacher contact in the KNP. Also read:  The Managing Executive of the KNP, Glenn Phillips commended the work of the rangers saying they are resilient in the aftermath of the tragic loss of a colleague. “The arrests are a sign that the spirit of Respect is being honoured by the Rangers Corps. Further to this, the fact that no poachers were wounded or killed in these contacts is a clear demonstration of the professionalism and discipline that embodies our Ranger Corps. There has been relentless poacher activity since his passing, with 156 activities reported and that includes contacts. We are still making a plea to our neighbouring communities to help us in this fight by exposing those who are exploiting their children, husbands and relatives to illegally hunt rhinos. These people do not have the welfare of the communities at heart but are criminals without a conscience and they need to be put behind bars for a long time for their criminal acts,” said Phillips. Also read:  The 23 arrested suspects were also in possession of ten high calibre rifles and suspected poaching equipment. They will be facing charges related to poaching and possession of unlicensed firearms and ammunition. Also read:
