 WHITE RIVER – The room went quiet when guest speaker, Daniel Silke, took to stage at the Casterbridge Barnyard Theatre. The political analyst, futurists and passionate speaker spoke on the topic “South Africa 2018 and beyond”, and how the country’s economy compares to the rest of the world. “In the rest of the world there are also political and economical uncertainties. We are not alone,” Silke said. “There are risks in everything we do, but remember that we are still better off than in the previous global credit crunch.” Silke also said that the economy takes centre stage in South Africa at the moment. “Our GDP has not kept up with our population growth and that is alarming. “The land issue will remain sensitive leading up to the elections in 2019. It is not going to be easy. We need solutions from everybody.” Alison Zweers, managing director of SPAR Lowveld, said they organised the regular breakfasts and enlightening speakers as a way of thanking the business community.
