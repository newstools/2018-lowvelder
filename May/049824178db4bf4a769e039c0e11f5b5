The suspects then blasted the safe open and fled the scene with an undisclosed amount of cash. Police were alerted about the heist and the three policemen driving with five others in a police Volkswagen Crafter minibus, were the first ones to arrive on the scene. When other SAPS members arrived, they were informed by community members that they saw some police officers who were travelling in the Crafter which had by then left a few minutes ago, taking money that was scattered around. The members were called while travelling at Dwarsloop and ordered to halt. When their colleagues arrived, they searched them and as a result the trio was nabbed after being allegedly found with some notes suspected to have been taken at the scene.

Zuma also commended the police for investigating the allegations and for not hesitating to bring their colleagues to book based on their findings. “The duty of the police at a crime scene is to safe guard it, protect property and all other exhibits lying around but not to tamper and take anything from it. I believe that the arrest of these members will serve as a deterrent to others who might be tempted to cross the line at any time,” said Zuma.
