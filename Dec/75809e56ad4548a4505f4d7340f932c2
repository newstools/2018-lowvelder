 MBOMBELA –  Public relations officer at Sembcorp Silulumanzi Lerato Mashua said these scam artists were conning Mbombela residents and customers, especially in the Stonehenge area. “These scam artists are convincing residents to allow them entry to their premises as they need to disconnect their water in exchange of paying them cash to avoid such disconnections. We can assure customers and members of the public that this is not the way Sembcorp Silulumanzi does things. Our field staff employees do not handle cash.” All such transactions are done through Sembcorp Silulumanzi customer care centres and via the appropriate channels. “We ask our customers to be alert and vigilant. Customers should not provide any information nor send or give any cash to field staff workers.” Any member of the public can verify whether visitors to their home are in fact employed by Sembcorp Silulumanzi by: Phoning the control room or customer care offices on 0861-745-858 to confirm whether work is being carried out in their area. Informing the alleged official that they will allow them entry only once the Silulumanzi has verified their identity. Residents should please inform the South African Police Service as well as Sembcorp Silulumanzi if they are approached by potential criminals.
