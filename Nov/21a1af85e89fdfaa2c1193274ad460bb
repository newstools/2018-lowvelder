 SKUKUZA – After a slew of tactical delays dating back to Patrick Nkuna’s arrest in November 2015, Nkuna was charged with 12 counts, including four counts of attempted murder, trespassing in a National Park, and possession of an illegal firearm. Bomb discovered in KNP Nkuna appeared in the Skukuza Magistrate Court last week. Some of the delays in the case apparently included his demand for better Shangaan interpreters on three previous occasions. SANParks helicopter pilot Bradford Grafton, in dramatic testimony described how the accused was finally apprehended after a long chase that began with a sighting of poachers in the Pretoriuskop area. At the time, Bradford was carrying a SANParks delegation on board, which included General Johan Jooste, Kruger South Regional Ranger Don English, CEO Fundisile Mketeni, and one board member. Former Skukuza captain released on bail He was sentenced to more than 40 years, and 33 years and three months effectively. Since this 2015 incident, the helicopter has been shot at in four separate incidents by poachers. Last week, the chopper and a fixed wing plane came under fire again. This verdict by Magistrate Cloete sends out a clear message to the most ruthless of poachers.
