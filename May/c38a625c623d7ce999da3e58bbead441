In 2012 he became a full colonel and in 2018 he attained the rank of brigadier and was given the post in Mbombela. “I am meeting with the community police forums and all the various security companies to get community involvement to assist in the fight against crime. I have a clear mission. That is to reduce crime. The community must feel safe in their houses.” Ngobeni said his door was open to the community. “Let us exchange views and information. Give us your input. Let us make Mbombela a safer place.” He added that he was going to ensure serious criminals and repeat offenders were refused bail. “I will be meeting with prosecutors to work together to see how we are going to fight crime and ensure serious criminals do not roam the streets.” Ngobeni also stated that CCTV cameras must be revived in the city. “I want to thank Brig Gerrie Agenbag for the good work he has done. He has left a high standard of disciplined members.” Agenbag was transferred to the provincial detective office.

Every concerned citizen wants to see crime dealt with accordingly.” Enquiries: Ngobeni on 066-480-1408.
