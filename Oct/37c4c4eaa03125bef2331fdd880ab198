For the past three years the University of Mpumalanga has been an ongoing project for both Mpumalanga clay brick manufacturers. Malelane Stene has provided, to date, 3.3 million solid clay stock bricks in total to both Trencon and Norse Projects. These solid stock bricks have been used for the foundations and the inside walls of the University. Federale Stene is the proud facebrick supplier for this project. The beautiful Plum Satin facebrick features a smooth, deep purple colour on the front of the brick and a lighter textured colour on the reverse which architects have creatively made use of so that each individual building has itâ€™s own unique look. When taking a walk through the buildings one quickly realises that there is more to clay bricks than meets the eye. The aesthetics provided by the architectural designs really makes for a pleasing, learning experience students will enjoy for many generations to come. Completed buildings have already started serving as spaces for classrooms, laboratories, food courts, student living quarters, administrative offices as well as alumni offices. The beauty of a good quality clay brick is that there is no need to plaster or paint them. These bricks provide a long-lasting, natural colour that requires very little maintenance and they withstand most extreme weather conditions. This means that in the long run, you save on unnecessary upkeep costs.  You should be building with the best too! Get in contact with either Federale Stene or Malelane Stene today.
