 MBOMBELA – A case of reckless and negligent driving has been opened following the motorcycle accident of Johan Rossouw on November 10. The accident happened on the R40 crossing at the road leading to the University of Mpumalanga. Moeti Mmusi, Department of Community Safety, Security and Liaison, confirmed that a case has been opened at the Nelspruit Police Station. “The damage that was found on both of the vehicles indicated that it could not have been extensive speed on the part of the motorcycle driver. It does, however, indicate that there is a probability that the bakkie driver crossed the road unsafely,” he said. Rossouw’s father, Gert, said they are not concerned with the case at this stage.
