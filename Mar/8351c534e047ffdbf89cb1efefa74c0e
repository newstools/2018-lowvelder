 MBOMBELA – The court drama surrounding Bundu Lodge came to an end on Friday in the Mpumalanga High Court. The judge, Henk Roelofse, ordered that the iconic restful abode will be sold to a company called Ebundu (Pty) Ltd. This outcome mirrored the crux of a sale agreement concluded between lodge founder and owner Willem Konstantyn Janson and Ebundu.* However, Janson wanted out and alleged non-compliance by the purchasers – a move Roelofse labelled “perverse and an afterthought, most probably brought about by seller’s remorse”. Ebundu’s representatives are Sibusiso and Ntombizodwa Tshabalala. In September last year, they contracted with Janson to buy the lodge from him. Three months later, Janson and Bundu manager, William Blake alleged that the deal fell through. This aggrieved the Tshabalalas, who maintained that they never failed to comply with the agreement and that it was still in effect. A court battle followed in which Roelofse was tasked with determining whether the agreement would be enforced or not. He considered the deal between the Tshabalalas and Janson.
