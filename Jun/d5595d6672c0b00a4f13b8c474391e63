 LETSITELE –  Last night at about 18:30, G4S security officers were transporting money along the R71 between Letsitele and Tarentaal outside Tzaneen when about 10 suspects travelling in two vehicles accosted them.  According to Limpopo police spokesman Brig Motlafela Mojapelo, the suspects suddenly started firing at the wheels of the security vehicle. “After it came to a halt, they ordered the three security officers out at gunpoint before blasting it open with explosives.”  The suspects fled the scene after taking an undisclosed amount of money. “The police were called and reacted swiftly. Within minutes the vehicles were spotted.” A car chase ensued along the Hoedspruit/Lydenburg road. Members of the Farm Watch joined and assisted in blocking the route.  “One of the vehicles was cornered next to Swadini in Hoedspruit policing area and a shootout ensued,” Mojapelo stated. Of the five suspects who were in the car, three aged between 43 and 25 were caught by police. “One managed to flee and the one suspect was fatally wounded.” The three suspects and the deceased are from Burgersfort, Burgersdorp outside Tzaneen, Hazyview and Bushbuckridge in Mpumalanga. The other vehicle was cornered next to Strydom tunnel and after a shootout, the suspects abandoned it and fled on foot.  “The police managed to apprehend one of them and others are still being pursued,” Mojapelo said. The following items were recovered:
• A white Mercedes Benz ML
• A black Audi
• Two AK 47 rifles
• A R4 rifle
• A Baretta pistol
• Two police bulletproof vests
• Two army bulletproof vests
• A two-way radio
• Two bags of money
• The blue lights “The arrested suspects are likely to be linked with other cash-in-transit heists committed in Limpopo and Mpumalanga,” he added. The Limpopo Provincial Police Commissioner, Lt Gen Nneke Ledwaba, commended the members for their swift response. “This is yet another message that we are sending to other criminals out there that their days are numbered,” said Ledwaba. The suspects will appear in Tzaneen Magistrate’s Court soon. More arrests are expected. ALSO READ : CIT heists on the increase in the Lowveld
