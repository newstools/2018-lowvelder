 MBOMBELA – In days not too long ago, the local social calendar of Nelspruit featured quite a number of formal balls. Often an evening of dinner and dance was offered by one of the hotels and night clubs in town. During the annual show the police, Rotary and rugby clubs held dances in the former city hall where well-dressed couples moved to the sounds of “La Mer”, “Sway”, “Hernando’s Hideaway” or “La Cumparsita”.\ Read more: Remember dancing to these hits in the 1970s?
