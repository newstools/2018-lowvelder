 MBOMBELA – Provincial leader of the EFF, Colin Sedibe was astounded when he heard that the i’langa Mall branch of Swedish clothing giant, H&M was open for business earlier today. Sedibe told Lowvelder that party members were on their way to the mall to demand that management close the store. “If they refuse to do so, we will vandalise the shop.”  Over the weekend, the party staged protests at H&M stores in Gauteng, the Western Cape, Limpopo, Mpumalanga and KwaZulu-Natal against alleged racism after a catalogue photograph in which a little black boy wears a hoodie bearing the slogan “coolest monkey in the jungle” was published. General manager of i’langa, Sandy Human said they were blessed with no violence over the weekend, but the mall has rolled out an action plan in case something does happen. “We have armed response standing by.”
