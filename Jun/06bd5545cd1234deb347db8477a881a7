 TEKWANE SOUTH – The Ehlanzeni Diving Unit’s two-week-long search for the 35-year-old man who went missing just less than a month ago, concluded on Wednesday. Capt Pottie Potgieter and his team had without any solid leads been scouring the Crocodile River for 15 days, but to no avail. According to a family member, the man was last seen on May 30, but the police were only notified a week later and the search immediately commenced. He was apparently embarking on his routine fishing trip to the river. “He religiously leaves every morning and returns at night,” the family member told Potgieter. When he did not return, they started looking for him, but without success. Potgieter and his team faced crocodile and hippo-infested water, as well as thick bush to look for the man, and eventually found his body on the riverbank around 100 metres from where he was last seen in the Tekwane South area. “There are no clear signs of drowning and the cause of death is pending an autopsy,” said Potgieter. The victim’s identity was not known at the time of going to press. Also read: Two field rangers among five arrested for alleged poaching at the KNP
