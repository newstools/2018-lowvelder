It is alleged that a scuffle ensued when an employee of Absa picked up a hitchhiker near BUCO in White River.
A patrol vehicle of the KaBokweni Taxi Association, which protects the route for the association’s taxis, saw him pick the hitchhiker up. They followed him with their Toyota Corolla until he came to a standstill at Platsak, when they confronted him about picking up a hitchhiker.
“He retaliated as it is believed that he mistook the confrontation for a robbery,” said the store manager of SaveMor, Clinton van der Nest. He explained that some of his staff witnessed the incident.
“He shot one of the ‘attackers’ in his arm and shot out all four of their vehicle’s tyres in order to prevent them from fleeing the scene,” Van der Nest said. The shot victim then hid in a restroom on the premises while the other made a run for it. Other taxi drivers who were allegedly called in by the association, started beating up the Absa employee and according to witnesses, kicked him while he was on the ground.
The police and J&M Security arrived and managed to restore calm. Sgt Cynthia Mbokodo said the alleged shooter was taken to Mediclinic Nelspruit where he is being treated. The man who was shot was taken to Themba Hospital.
Mbokodo added that a case of attempted murder is being investigated, but would not divulge against who, as the case is still under investigation. You might also be interested in: Two men that were arrested for Sabie robbery
