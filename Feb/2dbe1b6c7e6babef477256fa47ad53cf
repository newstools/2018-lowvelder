BARBERTON – A G4S employee was shot twice during in what is believed to have been a failed Cash in Transit Heist at around 18:00 this evening.
The suspects, travelling in a BMW X5 and a Range Rover, shot the vehicle’s tires out in an attempt to bring it to a standstill. “Two of the bullets got lodged in the driver’s legs,” said J&M Security’s Shaun Terblanche.
The incident occurred in the vicinity of Nelshoogte Nature Reserve, near the R40/R38 intersection.
When they eventually succeeded, the vehicle came to a standstill in front of the premier’s home, which is constantly under police guard. “The officers had witnessed the incident and confronted the suspects, after which they made a run for it,” said Terblanche.
It is believed that that the suspects are currently heading in the direction of Kaapmuiden. Also read: Lowvelder remembers Lily Mine tragedy Horns of two rhinos seized on N4
