 MBOMBELA – Robin Auld promises to perform his crowd-favourite hits from the 1980s at the upcoming BosRock. Fans can certainly look forward to performances of “All of Woman” and “Baby You’ve Been Good”, he told Lowvelder. Auld will be performing at the first-ever hard rock BosRock concert in the Lowveld with the RIDERS (Mel Botes, Valiant Swart, Piet Botha, Arthur and Rudolph Dennis from Akkedis).

Auld said he has been working more on producing other artists since his last album, Back of the Line, came out in 2013. He started a small label, Shoreline Songs, with heritage artists such as Tim Parr (formerly from Elemental) as well as up-and-coming folk acts. “We are establishing a publishing scenario where we produce music for movies and documentaries,” he adds. “It takes a lot of time, and I am looking to start working on my own stuff again.” For now he plays with the RIDERS. “It is great fun. I get to hang out with my friends. We don’t see each other very much. We just have fun.” Seeing the RIDERS together on stage is a rarity, due to the members’ schedules. The BosRock audience are thus in for a treat. From Auld they can expect a lot of ’80s songs and blues. “It is a very guitar-oriented show,” he adds. If old-school hard rock from the ’60s to ’80s is your cup of tea, don’t miss BosRock.  It takes place at Kwanyoni Lodge on October 6 from 12:00 til late. BosRock is brought to you in a partnership between Lowvelder, Mahindra Nelspruit, Storm Produktionz, Panarottis i’langa, AVS Hire, Harley-Davidson Big Five, Moroccan Barber, Nkomazi Fuel, Food Fundi and Uniwisp. On the day concertgoers can also park for free at i’langa Mall on the day to catch a ride with Citybug for R20 to the venue and back. Tickets start at R100 up to R300, and are available from Computicket.
