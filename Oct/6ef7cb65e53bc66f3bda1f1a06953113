 MBOMBELA – For Miss Mpumalanga, Vanessa Hollenbach, a hand that gives is a hand that receives. That is why she decided to celebrate her 19th birthday by giving back to the community and especially to a place she holds very dear to her heart.  That place is none other than her alma mater, Nelspruit Primary. She hosted a fun day for the school on Friday.  Children had the opportunity to participate in various activities like water slides, face painting and learning a bit more about soccer from the professional players all the way from Bushbuckridge.  These athletes shared in the gift of giving and donated two soccer kits and two netball kits to the school.

The excitement was clearly visible on the children’s faces as they sang happy birthday to Hollenbach.  Then they proceeded to the rugby field for a day of fun in the sun.
