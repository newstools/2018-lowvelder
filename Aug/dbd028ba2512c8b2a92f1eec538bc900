 KANYAMAZANE – Following the severe hailstorm in May this year residents of KaNyamazane who suffered severe damage to property are at loggerheads with local government pending assistance with repairs. The following message has been circulated on WhatsApp suggesting that residents are planning to enbark on a protest to voice their discontent. Planned protest march by KaNyamazane community members on Monday 2018/08/13 @ 04h00. On Saturday 2018/08/09 at 10:00 Kanyamazane community members held a meeting at KaNyamazane Community Hall about the cancellation of a project which was supposed to repair all houses damaged by the hailstorms during May 2018. Since then most of the houses were never repaired as promised by Mpumalanga Disaster Management. Residents were told that there is no money. Therefore the community members are going to barricades the N4 and all roads around KaNyamazane, Thekwane South and Entokozweni with burning tyres and stones. Protesters promised not to disturb any schools during the protest. They are demanding that president Ramophosa or deputy president Mr Mabuza should come down to resolve their frustration. They also complain about the poor roads and street lights at kaNyamazane. They threatened that if their demands are not met, they will continue to protest until national office comes to them. Secondly they don’t want to talk to Mpumalanga Province leadership because they are not honest to them. Although the origin of the messages could not be verified members of the public are urged to avoid these areas if possible and be cautious.
