 HAZYVIEW – The provincial Department of Public Works, Roads and Transport (DPWRT) has started repairs on the R536 road between Sabie and Hazyview. A report in Lowvelder on Tuesday stated that due to consistent negligence by the DPWRT, both the R536 and D514 roads’ surfaces had deteriorated to the point where approximately 1 700 potholes were counted on a 13-kilometre stretch of the D514, and more than 600 on a similar stretch of the R536.

I am, however, not satisfied with the work because reports have come back to me that the contractors are only repairing the worst potholes. Due to the far-reaching deterioration of the road it is time that the DPWRT makes available a budget to resurface the road,” said MP Ken Robertson. He added that with regard to the D514 road, he will be submitting written requests to MPL Bosman Grobler, who will further engage the provincial legislature.

The last information I received was that repairs had started on Tuesday January 16,” said Grobler.
