 BARBERTON – Inmates of the town’s Maximum B Correctional Centre called off their four-day-long hunger strike on Sunday.
According to Mesia Hlungwani, Department of Correctional Services (DCS) spokesman, 96 prisoners serving life sentences started the strike on Thursday by refusing to eat breakfast.
They called it off at around 21:30 on Sunday.  Among the issues they were complaining of was a delay in the processing of their parole applications. “Kenneth Mthombeni, acting regional commissioner from the regional office, was instructed to travel and attend to the matter,” Hlungwani said. “The hunger strike was called off after all the issues were satisfactorily addressed and all offenders were happy.”
The issues raised included delays in the processing and consideration of profiles by the National Council for Correctional Services (NCCS), and the reasonableness of further profiling. Hlungwani said the backlog had been addressed.  He said the prisoners proposed that NCCS review its processes. These proposals will be submitted by this coming Friday.
The spokesman said they resolved to follow up on 95 profiles submitted to the regional office and establish a quality assurance committee to manage the quality of profiles to be submitted.
He said 18 profiles were completed in December last year and will reach the regional office by Friday. “The 28 profiles that are under consideration by the correctional supervision and parole board will reach the regional office on February 15. Offenders are satisfied with the commitment of the department in resolving their concerns,” added Hlungwani.
