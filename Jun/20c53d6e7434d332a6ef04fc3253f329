 Saturday afternoon saw an impressive and powerful gathering of women at the Union Grove Church. This year, Women of Excellence was held under the theme, “Woman, you are enough”. They came dressed to impress in black and deep pink, and their message was an important one.  The event was hosted and organised by Lady Evelyn Sukamanga, who saw a need to address challenges that face today’s women, both single and married.  According to Sukamanga, these are often sidelined and not adequately addressed. They may be uncomfortable topics, but in-depth conversations need to address relevant issues. Women of Excellence provides these platforms for questions and discussions among diverse backgrounds. It takes place once a year, but additional projects and programmes are in the pipeline. Evelyn explains her vision: “I vowed to stand in the gap and serve God by serving the women who really seek Him and want to make a difference. I wanted to eradicate and deal with the attitude that destroys relationships and hurts others’ rights in the church by speaking to women and finding common ground on the issues that we face on a daily basis. Something that will unite us in truth and in spirit, and eradicate the ‘holier than thou’ attitude while you feel empty inside.” During the event the Word of God was preached, and experts spoke to the attendees about various themes. They were invited to ask questions or comment on the topics. The women came from as far away as Limpopo and Gauteng. The atmosphere was electric and uplifting, and with inspirational speakers such as Alcy Tivane giving her emotive input, the event was a powerful dedication to an all-important topic.
