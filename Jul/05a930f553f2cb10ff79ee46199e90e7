 MBOMBELA – Two men, believed to be in their early thirties, were killed this morning and another is in critical condition when a vehicle collided into two stationary vehicles on the KaNyamazane Road. Seven people were involved in the accident which happened at around 05:30.  An eye-witness said a white Volkswagen Polo was towing a red Opel Corsa which was travelling towards Tekwane South. ” They had stopped half in the emergency lane.”  The witness added that a white Hyundai  collided into the red Corsa crushing the driver of the Corsa who was standing next to his vehicle who landed underneath it. “The Corsa then hit the white Polo and in the process, the Hyundai lost control and rolled down the embankment. While it was rolling down the embankment, a passenger of the Hyundai ejected and died at the scene.”  Emer-G-Med operations manager Martin Jeffrey said the two men were declared dead at the scene. “It was extremely heartbreaking as the families of the deceased arrived.”  He said all the survivors were transported to Mediclinic Nelspruit and Rob Ferreira Hospital.
