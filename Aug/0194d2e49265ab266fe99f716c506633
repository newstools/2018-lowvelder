 MBOMBELA – The 48-year-old Lowveld native is now the face of Hoërskool Nelspruit’s siSwati classes. She has been in the teaching industry since 1990 and appreciates her role in shaping the minds and experiences of pupils who, as adults, need to understand the different cultures of South Africa. “I am hoping that the white pupils will be able to fit in and interact with siSwati-speaking pupils. I want them to be curious about not only getting to know the language, but the culture as well.” She started her career at Enzani Primary School and later she taught at Matsulu Primary School, where her father was also the headmaster. Mokoena teaches grade eight and nine pupils. The very first class she taught at NHS was how to greet one another in siSwati and getting to know one another. Nonhlanhla Mokoena. Sawubona (Good morning). Ungubani ligama lakho? (What is your name) She has a passion for kids and has also learned more about the Afrikaans culture since she became part of the NHS team in the beginning of the third semester. “I have to learn Afrikaans and be able to speak it. I must say mine has improved immensely since I started at NHS and I find the kids lovely. The learners correct me in Afrikaans and it is so rewarding to see how the pupils in my class’ knowledge of the language and of the culture is moving forward.”  Her mother, who sadly passed away when Mokoena was only 14 years old, was a dressmaker. In Mokoena’s spare time, she makes clothes for any occasion. She also enjoys reading inspirational books and is currently busy with Joyce Meyer’s Battlefield of the Mind.
