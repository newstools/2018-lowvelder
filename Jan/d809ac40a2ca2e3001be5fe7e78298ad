 MBOMBELA – Charles Nel, chair of Laerskool Nelspruit’s governing body, said the newspaper’s questions were the first they had heard of the planned protest action. He added that the school was strongly opposed to it. “The safety of learners, personnel and parents is priority,” he said. The school’s SGB was to meet at 17:00, after which a plan of action would be communicated to all parents.

Provincial party leader, Collen Sedibe, posted on his Facebook page on Sunday that all parents of learners and residents were invited “to a protest against the exclusion of blacks” at Hoërskool Nelspruit. However, on Monday he told Lowvelder that he in fact meant Laerskool Nelspruit and that the aim was to draw attention to the fact that there were too few schools in town. “We want to put pressure on the government to either add more classes to schools or build more schools,” he said. The protest is scheduled as follows: Tuesday at 07:00 at Laerskool Nelspruit gate.
