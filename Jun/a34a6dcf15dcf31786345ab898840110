 MBOMBELA – Richard Prinsloo was allegedly attacked by the underaged learner on March 5. It is alleged that children had to pull the attacker off Prinsloo. His glasses were broken and his eye, elbow, ribs and knee were injured during the attack. After the incident he opened a case of assault against the pupil. The minor has since left the school.
He reappeared in the Nelspruit Magistrate’s Court on Monday. Police spokesman Erhard Stroh said the National Institute for Crime Prevention and the Reintegration of Offenders (NICRO) recommended that the charge of assault with the intention to inflict grievous bodily harm be withdrawn. “The matter was finalised,” Stroh told Lowvelder. “The magistrate ruled that the boy must continue seeing a psychologist for the next six months and attend a NICRO anger managment course.” Prinsloo said he was deeply shocked to hear the outcome of the case. He has been booked off sick since the incident. He had been served with a letter of intent to suspend him from the Department of Education the day after the incident. It related to a grievance lodged by six parents who complained about alleged verbal abuse and his conduct towards pupils. Provincial Department of Education spokesman Gerald Sambo said they had received another medical report from a doctor and were unable to continue with disciplinary actions until Prinsloo had recovered.
