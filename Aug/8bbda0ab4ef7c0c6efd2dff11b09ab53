Cycle Tribe, formerly known as The Bicycle Company, has undergone a brand and identity revamp and they’d like to invite the community to join in the celebrations at their upcoming relaunch, which will be held at their store in the Riverside Precinct, with fun activities for the entire family as well as a road ride open for all. Bring the kids for some fun on the jumping castles while enjoying complimentary boerewors rolls and slush puppies as you view the new store in all its glory. Discounts will be offered on bikes and gear as well as accessories on the day of the relaunch. The shop is managed by the trusted Johnny Diedericks, Ricca Kwele, Sue Watson, Mitchell Arntzen, Sibongile Gama, December Zulu,  Anton van Tonder and Sibusiso Kgoedi The road ride will begin at the store on the day of the relaunch in groups according to how far you’d like to cycle; heading up to Sabie through Renoster Hoek and back to the store. This two to three-hour ride will be around 100km long and will be guided by two safety vehicles that will provide the cyclists with refreshments along the way. If you are interested in joining Cycle Tribe’s monthly beginners cycling rides in Nelspruit, you can also register here on the launch day and get expert advice from Mitch and his team. Cycle Tribe hosts group rides from Halls Gateway every second Sunday and from Magnolia Mountain Biking Trail in White River every Thursday.
