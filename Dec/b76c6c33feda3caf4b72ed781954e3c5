MBOMBELA – Police spokesman Capt Zandile Gqawa said an unknown man walked in and asked if there was a room available. “Suddenly a group of armed men rushed in. They tied the staff member up and pushed her into a store room. They took TVs, a tablet and cash. They got away in White Toyota Hilux with no registration plates.”  Hi-Tech Security Lowveld operations manager Callum Mac Pherson said their officers had also responded to the scene. “There were seven suspects involved.  They had roughed her up, so we had our medical team to help her with her injuries.” Gqawa said police had opened a case of business robbery. No arrests have yet been made.
