GT and Lizelle Lundie met while they were both working at Singita, a luxurious private game lodge in Mpumalanga. They set off to work their way along the culinary routes of London and Scotland together for a year. On their return, GT was instrumental in elevating Roots (at the Cradle of Humankind) to one of the top ten restaurants in South Africa. But they could not shake the magnetic pull of the Lowveld and the desire to have their own restaurant.  The couple finally realised this dream and came full circle when they opened Orange Restaurant in Nelspruit in November 2007. Soon, they were raking in awards and catering for a full house every night. Three years later, this husband-and-wife team seized the opportunity to bring exceptional dining to a wider audience and Zest was born.
