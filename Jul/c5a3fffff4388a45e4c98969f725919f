 SABIE – The Department of Public Works, Roads and Transport has declared war on potholes in the province, but it seems like it is yet to start. Potholes on the R536, betwen Sabie and Hazyview. This “War on Potholes” programme was introduced in May 2017 in a bid to aggressively attend to potholes across the provincial road network. The initiative was done together with all social partners which included among others; municipalities, government agencies, the private sector and communities. According to Ehlanzeni District head, David Nkambule, it is steadfast in its stance to eradicate potholes in the province through this initiative. Head of the department, Sindisiwe Xulu, aims to have motorist driving with ease, without fear of damaging their vehicles because of such holes in the roads. “This will equally benefit pedestrians, who are forced to share the pavement with vehicles due to unbearable potholes,” she said. The exercise started on July 6. You would think that roads which carry an influx of tourism in the province like the R536 between Sabie and Hazyview would be top priority, yet it is still ridden with potholes with little to no visible repairs happening.  “This initiative is in support of the overall plan of the department as highlighted on the policy and budget speech, that the department will intensify the war on potholes in the 2018/19 financial year. The department has a short- and long-term plan to address the deteriorating condition of roads. In the short term, the department plans to patch potholes, clean drainage systems and cut grass along the roads. A total of 44 per cent of the department’s budget, which is more than R2 billion, will go towards planning, designing, construction and maintenance of the provincial road network,” said Xulu.
