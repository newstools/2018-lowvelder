 PILGRIM’S REST – So seriously the MEC regarded the matter that he took along the HOD, Sindiwe Xulu, and arrived there on time, at 12:00 as the people demanded. These actions followed on the eve of the biannual Pilgrim’s Rest heritage weekend staged by the townsfolk, local museum services and Mpumalanga Heritage, that took place this past weekend. Earlier during the day a busload of foreign tourists was caught up in the midst of the protest. Pilgrim’s Rest is an important provincial tourism attraction and has practically been brought to its knees by the indecisive actions of the province, which remains reluctant finalisetenders to operators of tourism-related businesses. Most of these premises stand empty. The local community is left without job possibilities and income. The derelict museum village has also lost much of its visitors of the past. In the streets vendors beg to sell their wares and handcraft at far less than normal prices to the few reluctant visitors. These conditions were also highlighted on SABC on Sunday night. Though not confirmed by public works, but established by Lowvelder after a visit to Pilgrim’s Rest this weekend, the protesting people on Thursday were demanding that Mashego’s department get its act together in finalising the tender process to secure proper business practices.

This is amidst serious cautions by operators as well as members of the community that Pilgrim’s Rest has become a time bomb waiting to explode in the face of the MEC and his department. Though a media enquiry concerning this was already put to the spokesman of public works, roads and transport, David Nkambule on that same day, he since has not been available for comment.
