Source: Wikipedia • Armistice Day, Remembrance Day or Veterans’ Day is commemorated in many countries involved in World War I on November 11 every year or on the Sunday nearest to it (or, as is becoming more common, on both days). Several countries remember the people lost during the First World War and other wars by holding a two-minute silence at 11:00 on that day.
• The first official observance of Armistice Day took place on November 11, 1919 at Buckingham Palace in London, England.
• Norway, Denmark, and the Netherlands do not commemorate Armistice Day, as they remained neutral during World War I.
• In France, Armistice Day is a proclaimed public holiday, resulting in the closure of many businesses.
• The Armistice was an agreement signed by representatives of France, Great Britain and Germany. It was an agreement to end fighting as a prelude to peace negotiations. The Treaty of Versailles signed six months later would act as the peace treaty between the nations.
• In 1940, another armistice was signed in the same railway carriage in the Forest of Compiègne. This time it was Germany forcing France to sign an agreement to end fighting against them in World War Two, which was essentially a French surrender. To add to the deliberate humiliation, Adolf Hitler sat in the same seat that Ferdinand Foch sat in in 1918. The carriage was taken and exhibited in Germany, but was destroyed in 1945.
• If Germany broke any of the terms of the Armistice, such as not evacuating areas they were ordered to evacuate, not handing over weapons or prisoners of war in the timescales given or causing damage to any individual or their property, fighting would begin again with 48 hours notice.
• Germany was ordered to provide information about the location of mines or traps they had placed and reveal what other things they had deliberately destroyed or caused damage to (such as polluting or poisoning springs or wells).
• By signing The Armistice and the Treaty of Versailles, Germany were made to accept the blame for the First World War and would have to pay reparations for the damage caused, estimated to total about £22 billion (R411 billion in current money). It was only in 2010 that Germany paid off its war debt, with a final payment of £59 million (R1 billion).
• Whereas Germany viewed the terms of the Armistice, and the Treaty of Versailles signed the following year, as too harsh, the French saw it as too lenient. Sources: Toptenfacts.co.uk / softschools.com  The horrors of Flanders was ended with the signing of the Armistice.
