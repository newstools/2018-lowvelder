 MBOMBELA – A roaring lion here and a trumpeting elephant there. This is how the play of Penryn Pre-School unfolded on Tuesday morning and Wednesday evening.  Though the audience quickly learned that these glorious animals were not the main focus of the play, but rather a different group of animals called “The Ugly Five”.

It tells the story of how the popular animals are mean to the so-called ugly ones, but how everybody finds their place in the end.  “Our ugly five were a hadida, warthog, crocodile, hyena and wildebeest,” said director of the play and teacher, Tammy Clarke.  “We wanted to create awareness of animals and also teach children that all animals and people are beautiful even if they look different,” Clarke said.  The children on the stage were between the ages of two and six.
