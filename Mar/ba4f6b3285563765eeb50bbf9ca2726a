 WHITE RIVER – Three armed suspects who burgled an MTN store at White River Square, threatened the staff that if they should call for help, they would all die together. According to police spokesman, Sgt Cynthia Mbokodo, the incident occurred at 13:00 on Thursday. Video footage from Pick n Pay shows how the suspects walked around talking on their phones before targeting the neighbouring store. MTN store manager Catherine Ndwamato said a man wearing dirty overalls entered first. “My colleague went to assist him as he said he was looking to buy a phone.” Two suspects walk around the Pick n Pay just before the armed robbery. Another two entered the store. “The one man lifted his shirt and showed me he had a firearm. He told me we must not press any panic buttons or try to call anyone or we would all die together.” She said the men forced them into the back of the store. “They made us lie down and tied our hands behind our backs with cable ties.” They then grabbed Ndwamato and instructed her to open the safe. “I was so scared, my hands were shaking so much. I kept making mistakes with the code and it kept saying error.” At the same time a customer walked into the store. One of the suspects went to him and told him the system was down and to return later. “One of the other men said I was playing for time with them as I could not open the safe, and started threatening me with my life. I told them to just take the money under the counter and leave.” The trio took laptops and cellphones and an undisclosed amount of money and fled the scene. “We do not know how they left as we were all still in the back. I managed to free myself and then I helped untie the other staff members. We then hit the panic button and the police arrived,” she stated. Mbokodo said no arrests have yet been made and anyone with information regarding the incident should immediately contact the investigating officer, Capt Skhumbuso Mkhatshwa on 082-449-0334. .
