The centre looks after up to 70 less- fortunate children ranging from one to 18 years of age and it relies solely on donations from the community and businesses. “Every month we ask our customers to nominate a charity of their choice during the first two weeks and then the charity with the most votes or nominations receives our focus the following month, where we give them the opportunity to be in store to interact with our customers and tell them a bit more about their cause,” Odendaal explained.
