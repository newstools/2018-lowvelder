 A jovial vibe was the name of the game on Friday night at The Pub in Mbombela as the partygoers celebrated the laid-back sounds of local band The Acoustics, comprising Ryan Grunow, Sakkie Tait, Davis Schutte and Paul Brummer. January means slim pickings when it comes to events, but this band never disappoints. Featuring timeless classics such as “Knocking on Heaven’s Door”, “What’s Up”, “Radar Love” and “Money for Nothing”, there was a definite feeling of old-school good times.
On the evening, the song choice and the vibe were the ideal things for easing back into the daily grind of a new year. The band’s renditions of timeless classics by Bob Seager, Creedence Clearwater Revival, Jethro Tull, John Mellencamp and The Beatles were crowd-pleasers. They performed a few of their own songs as well. The relaxed feeling at this much-loved venue went a long way towards audience participation and there was much foot stomping and back slapping as people came and went. Beer flowed and the pizzas were flying out of the kitchen at speed, as well as a few other speciality meals. The meals are not pretentious or fancy, but the menu is varied and very reasonably priced, and the food is good.
