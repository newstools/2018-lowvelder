 How so? Well, the various heats were not as overcrowded as at some of the previous meetings. This presented much more open racing with less pushing and wooing the barriers.  Also, Wayne “Witblitz” du Rand made his comeback after a suspension. The Rookies race was a mix of both male and females and here Angelique Barker, despite a wake-up call with the barriers, did not give an inch. She is really coming into her own. Her confidence into the corners has improved, so it really is enjoyable to watch her drive. As far as the pipe cars go, I am of the opinion that Freek Reynecke had the best-looking car.  He also finished second in his class. TJ Steyn had the better of him though, finishing in first. And then, I noticed that Hannecke Brits in her go-kart has adopted a similar style into the corners as one would use on a quad – she lays it into the corner. You go, girl! One of these days Oupa Hennie will have to upgrade her to a real car, hey? Nico Venter battled with his Midget in the first heat.  Nico, perhaps you should apply the push-cart philosophy – just saying! Well folks, the next race will be on November 17 and I predict a typical hot and sunny Lowveld day – so be there or forever hold your piece.
