Bosman was shot and killed in his home at around 22:00. He was watching television in the lounge while his wife was going to bed when three men walked in. Bosman told them to leave, and warned his wife Leigh to lock the bedroom door. She hit the panic button straight away. The men pulled out a knife and a gun and a scuffle ensued. It was apparently visible from the scene that there had been a
serious fight. Two shots went off, one of which hit Bosman in the chest. There were knife marks on his hands and arms. Hi-Tech Security armed response was there within minutes. The men took a key and were in the process of trying to steal a car when the security officers arrived. They abandoned their loot  and fled. Bossies Community Justice’s Albert Gryvenstein, who assisted police in the investigation, said this was yet another murder case that police had made a successful arrest for. “This should be a deterrent once again to criminals; if you commit a murder in our area, we will find you,” he said. Gryvenstein concluded that more arrests were to follow
