 MBOMBELA – The mostly self-taught 16-year-old orphan from Lowveld High School, Blessing Mabusela, is on his way to America. Up until last week, his dream was far from reality as he required a sponsorship to the value of approximately R70 000, with a deposit payable this week to secure his place. Since Blessing’s story appeared in Lowvelder last week, the school had an overwhelming response. He was on SABC News last week and his aunt was on the radio. In the meanwhile, two businessmen made a donation which totals well over R100 000, allowing him to attend one of America’s biggest talent shows, Talent America. This is the United States’ longest running talent competition and where many of today’s hottest actors, models, singers, dancers and entertainers got their big break. Blessing lost his mother when he was only one year old. His father died of a heart attack two years ago when he was 14. His journey to the show started when he entered his own contemporary dance piece in the 2017 Nelspruit Eisteddfod, where his remarkable talent was first noticed. He was then sponsored to start undergoing formal training in contemporary dance at Tolly’s Dance Academy in Mbombela. Blessing recently participated in the regional competition of Talent Africa, where he was given an award for best performance. He then qualified to go to the national leg of Talent Africa, in Johannesburg on April 7. He bagged gold and silver medals for contemporary dance and modelling respectively. He was also awarded federation colours and made it onto the South African team to participate in Talent America. Lowvelder would like to thank our readers for making Blessing’s dream a reality. The next Lowveld Talent Africa Regional Competition will be held in October, in order for contestants to qualify for the Talent Africa Nationals in Johannesburg in April next year, and ultimately the 46th Talent America.
