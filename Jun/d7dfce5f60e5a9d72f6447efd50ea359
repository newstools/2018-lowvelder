 MBOMBELA – The weather kept its sunny promise on Saturday and set the perfect scene for the Little Karoo Market. It started at 09:00 and hosted an array of stalls including clothing, jewellery and home-made gifts. A variety of foods and sweets was available, like home-made fudge, freshly baked cakes, vodka slush puppies and fresh farm produce.
Marketgoers were entertained by the Casterbridge Music Development Agency’s marimba band that came all the way from White River. A very special pancake stand, managed by Jason van Wyngaard’s own family,raised money for the Jason Foundation. He has cerebral palsy and the foundation aims to raise sufficient funds for him to get treatment. “He was diagnosed with cerebral palsy and has severe brain damage,” explained mom, Jackie van Wyngaard. “The only organisation that can provide the necessary therapy is the Family Hope Foundation in the USA.” The organisation will be in South Africa in 2019 and the family are raising funds to get Jason to the conference in Pretoria.
Little Karoo owner and market founder, Rowena Richardson, said this was the first day market they had held – they had previously held two night markets. “I feel so blessed today. It is so great for us to showcase great Lowveld stalls as well as show the locals what we do here,” said Richardson. “We have so much to offer for mind, body and soul and we want to thank everyone who supported us today and will do so the future.” READ ALSO: Christmas spirit brings Little Karoo to Mbombela
