Standard petrol has increased by one cent per litre, while diesel decreased by four cents.
Motorists were paying R16,02 per litre and they will thus pay R16,03 for 95 petrol. They will pay R15,81 for 93 petrol which use to be R15,80. Fortunately for some, diesel (wholesale) has gone down from R14.45 to R14.41. Lowvelder went to the streets of Mbombela to find out what residents had to say about the new prices.     Are you waiting for the one-cent decrease to fill up?
