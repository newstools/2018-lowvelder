 The wind sighed softly through the trees as Brian Wilkinson crooned into his microphone and an ice-cold beer landed on my table. A few sips later and the relaxation and lovely atmosphere that is Da Loose Mongoose kicked in. Also read: Bundu bliss with Mathys Roets Brett and Alicia Arntze. The live music featured every Sunday is certainly a drawcard, and today was no exception, with Wilkinson performing his special brand of foot-stomping and nostalgia-driven ’80s music. The food is always good. Tracey Gollitz’s signature brand of customer service comes through in everything she does.
You see her bustling from table to table, smiling broadly and greeting each guest by name. This is the sort of treatment that sets an establishment apart. Also read: Legendary birder and naturalist take you on a journey Mari and Willie Bartman. Jacqui Wilsenach from the Crafty Butcher laughs as she tells me that Da Loose Mongoose is where all the restaurateurs and their staff come on Sundays because most other places are closed and of course, you can let your hair down and take your shoes off, metaphorically and literally. There is a lovely bar area, but the first prize is sitting under the trees and listening to Wilkinson’s rocking sounds.
“Sweet Caroline” and “When I Wake Up In The Morning Light” got me tapping my feet and settling into the afternoon with relish. As night starts to fall, lamps are lit and a dreamy, romantic feeling settles over the company. Also read: A day filled with music at Da Loose Mongoose Susan Cavina and Aldea K. Sunday also sees the pizza/pasta special, buy any two and you get 50 per cent off the cheapest, and there is always live music, with no entry fee unless it is a special event. The food is delicious, the vibe laid-back and relaxed, and the gin ice cold and served in large blue-tinged glasses. What more could you want on a Sunday afternoon?
