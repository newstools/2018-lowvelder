 A tool has been developed by civic technology organisation OpenUp, in order to make it simple for anyone to make their voice heard on the critical issue of expropriation of land without compensation through online survey.  Give your feedback on land issues soon.  Although the Constitution already allows for land expropriation – without compensation – if it is “just and equitable”, if signed into law, this will be the first time an amendment has been made to the Bill of Rights. The Parliamentary Committee that will review Section 25 of the Constitution, which deals with property rights, has invited the public to participate in the debate, through a series of hearings and by engaging with the committee.
The committee wants all South Africans “to feel free to come and give their views and to be tolerant enough to allow those who have different views, to air their views”.   This online tool allows you to voice your opinion concerning land issues.  Using the tool, developed in partnership with the Parliamentary Monitoring Group, users are taken through a series of questions, which should take no longer than five minutes to answer. Once the questionnaire has been completed, it is then submitted to the committee via email. This fair survey allows you to voice your opinion and be heard.
