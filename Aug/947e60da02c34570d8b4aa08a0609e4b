 One just cannot trust the weatherman anymore. He said it will be 27, but it was not. But then again, come rain or shine, oval-track racers are always in the mood. Although, I must add that when I arrived at the oval on August 4, the mood was somewhat somber – the spectator stand was clearly not going to be packed like the previous events but hey, life can be quite moody at the best of times. So, let’s just chill!

Hanneke Brits decided to add netting to her go-cart-spider-mobile, just to be on the safe side. She was bouncing around the corners like popcorn in the microwave holding on for dear life, but eventually finished in first place for the day. Nico de Kock, in his blue and yellow Opel, was putting up a good show in his 2-litre 16-valve. The master of oval track racing, the honourable Nic de Witt, was having none of nobody’s 16-valves or whatever, and clinched the top spot in the Hotrod Class for this event. Adriaan Büser lead the way in the 2-litre Class.

If I was to be the judge, car 723, Willie de Witt from Loskop, would have received the prize for the best-looking car on the day. Quad bikes are returning to the oval and Neil de Witt, usually in a car, changed his seat on the day and by golly, won the class. We shall now call him Mr Interchangeable!
