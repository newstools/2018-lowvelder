 MBOMBELA – Stroh started his career in the police in 1985. “This December it will be 33 years I have been with the police. I started as a detective in 1992 at White River Police Station. I was with the Anti-Corruption Unit. In 1998, the then-police commissioner Jackie Selebi closed the unit.” Stroh said being part of the unit was a highlight in his career. In 2010, he was promoted to group leader of the detectives at Nelspruit Police Station. Stroh keeps his private life separate from his work. He is married and has a 19-year-old son from a previous marriage.
“I normally start my day at the station between 05:30 and 06:00. If I am not out of town investigating a case, I get home at around 17:00.” READ MORE in Tuesday’s Lowvelder.
