Another surprise awaited visitors, as there was also a snake show in one of the vacant camps, to teach visitors why they should not kill snakes.  Each visitor also received a free piece of birthday cake and had the chance to participate in the treasure hunt, as well as being a part of the grand opening of the new play area.
