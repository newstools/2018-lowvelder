 This week alone, there have been 4 cross pavement incidents and 3 vehicle attacks – one of these occurred in the Eastern Cape and two in Bloemfontein which is worrying as the crime could simply be dispersing into other areas.  Although no cash was taken, two CIT officers tragically lost their lives today in one of the incidents. Bartmann said following the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee meeting in June there had been intense pressure on all parties to curb the worrying increase in incidents. The South African Police Force had really stepped up the heat and the Joint Operations Control Centre (JOCC) which was set up between the SAPS the private security industry was working well.

According to the latest SABRIC statistics, a total of only 15 incidents were reported across the industry for the month of June. This is dramatically down from the 39 incidents reported in May and the lowest number of incidents recorded this year. “The July stats to date however paint a different picture,” cautions Bartmann. “It is imperative that all stakeholders continue to apply pressure. We need to maintain a high level of visible policing with dedicated CIT investigation teams that are actively involved in intelligence gathering and resource deployment.  It is essential we continue to treat CIT attacks as a priority crime,” concludes Bartmann.
