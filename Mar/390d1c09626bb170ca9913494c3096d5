 LONG TOM PASS – Yet another reckless driver landed in hot water for disregarding road laws on this dangerous mountain pass.  Bruce Macaulay, who made the post on Facebook exposing this driver, said it happened around 14:20 at the highest point of the pass. “The conditions were wet and misty and I was nearly pushed off the road,” he said. Cecile Vermaak Dorfling commented on Macaulay’s post, saying that she is a pile of nerves every time she has to drive through the Long Tom Pass.  Also read: Reckless driving continues in the Lowveld
The ambulance was followed by two other cars, who also passed vehicles on a solid line and drove on the wrong side of the road.
Dumisani Malamule, spokesman for the Mpumalanga Department of Health, said that it does not condone reckless driving with the exception of an emergency. “The drivers of our emergency vehicles then need to alert others with their warning lights,” he said.
“Through tracking systems we have identified this emergency vehicle as one of our own and we were also able to identify the driver. We are consulting all the necessary parties and we will decide what disciplinary actions will be taken against the driver,” Malamule said.
