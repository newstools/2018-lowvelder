 MBOMBELA – His death was unexpected. Pat was admitted to Mediclinic Nelspruit on Monday January 22 after which he had been diagnosed with pancreas cancer. Late last year, I was fortunate enough to meet Pat after I received a phone call from his daughter, Eve.
Most of the readers will hopefully remember the article I wrote about Pat. To be honest I had to pluck all my courage to make an appointment to go see him. But my oh my! I could listen to him for hours! I am so glad that I could share a part of Lowveld history that has never been told before. A MUST READ:  Last week Monday, Eve phoned me. She asked me if I could send her the photos that I took of her father during our interview. I asked her how is her dad doing in which she replied, ‘not good’. ‘Please tell me that you guys aren’t preparing for the worst. Unfortunately we are.’ On Wednesday I went to visit Pat in the hospital. Little did I know, that it would be the last time that I would see him. I sat next to his bed. It was heartbreaking – he looked so helpless. He said that he had no pain and that he is more than ready to kick the bucket. I smsed Eve on Sunday afternoon asking her how her father was doing. She replied ‘not good at all.’ I still though that I just want to pop in the following morning… Uncle Pat. I feel that there is so much more that you could have shared with me. I would have loved to write your autobiography. I am sorry that you will never be able to meet up with the love of your life, Joan. The funeral arrangements have not yet been finalised.  “Pat was a gentleman. He never spoke one bad word about others. We called him the bakers mans’ man. He had a big cookie jar and everyday at 14:15 during tee-time he would handout biscuits. Pat would take a walk with tannie Bes Kruger every afternoon and took good care of all the ladies. He was a lovely person and he will be sorrowfully missed” – Management of Herfsakker
