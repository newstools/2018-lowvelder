 Several big parties and festivals are being planned across the country for matrics to mark the end of their school careers. Sadly, every year there are incidents of matric deaths through road accidents, drinking, drug overdoses and more.  One of these incidents were already reported as, according to Mpumalanga News, six learners were injured and a 32-year-old man was shot dead during a “pens down party” in KaNyamazane on Monday. “We are appealing to matrics to party responsibly and never neglect their own personal safety,” says Charnel Hattingh, national marketing and communications manager at Fidelity ADT.
