 MBOMBELA – The joyful face of little Siyabonga Sbandze spoke volumes of the success of the Penreach Play Day.
The event was held at Mbombela Stadium last Thursday.  “We invited about 150 disadvantaged early childhood development (ECD) schools to participate in the event. We wanted the children to have a lovely day and to show the teachers that playing is important for children,” said Candice Streek, Penreach spokesman. There were 50 different stations and the children, who were all four-year-olds, had the chance to play at each of these. This included soccer, hula hoops, tea parties, reading and sack races. “Our focus this year was to use recycled materials for our games to show teachers that they do not have to spend money to create fun games for their children,” said Penreach ECD change agent, Adel Terblanche. “More schools participated than we anticipated but we are so happy that we had the chance to share this with them.”  Children and educators were also treated to ice-cold water by Oasis and hot dogs by The Winkler. “We had lots of fun today,” said Precious Mkhatshwa, ECD educator at Ilungelo Educare in Pienaar. “I am so happy that they showed us how we can play these games at our schools as well.” Thulile Makofane, Penreach ECD programme director, said educators do not realise the importance of play for children. “It is great for their holistic development and it is also important for them to learn how to interact with other children.” This is the second year the Penreach Play Day was held and they hope to make it an annual event.
