MBOMBELA – PENTalks is intended as a platform for sharing big ideas, significant research findings or profound life events with an appreciative audience.
This is exactly what Broodryk will do with his PENTalk – inspire young minds to create their own opportunities and make money while doing so.
He will also share some of his experiences in the industry and talk about how he overcame certain obstacles.
Broodryk’s book will also be for sale and attendees will only pay R120 instead of the R220 retail price.
