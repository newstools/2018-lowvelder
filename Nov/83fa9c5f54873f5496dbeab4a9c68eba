All their clothes were lost in the fire which did extensive damage to the kitchen and roof too. Now, they are planning to fix the house and will be staging a massive clean-up on Saturday morning.  Things to be done include removing the roof, removing all the burnt items from the house, and cleaning the inside of the house. Everybody is invited to join. It is set to start from 07:30 at the house located in Grace Street in Nelsville. Contact Mahlangu on 079-726-4042 or Gugu Macamo on 060-767-9713 for more information.
