 NKOMAZI – Siyabonga Tshabalala (27) and Nomuntu Ndhlovu’s (27) decision to leave their corporate jobs in Gauteng and go back home to their rural village of Steenbok in Nkomazi to start a business has paid off. The duo now run SiyaBuddy, a recycling and waste management company. It has now created 18 direct jobs and 541 indirect jobs in their community within the Nkomazi Local Municipality. The 541 indirect employees are residents who collect additional waste on behalf of Siyabuddy, at a fee. Armed with just a business plan the two young entrepreneurs applied to the Industrial Development Corporation (IDC) in 2016 for a business loan to purchase machinery to get their business off the ground. “Our application was successful and we used the loan to buy the machinery we needed to get started,” said Tshabalala. The R4,6 million loan from the IDC was used to purchase two baling machines, a forklift, three scales, a truck and office furniture for the start-up company. Siyabuddy collects waste from malls and other public waste dispensing places. They then process them in accordance with waste management handling.

From generating revenue of R10 000 per month in early 2016, SiyaBuddy has increased income to more than R200 000 per month. “The business is growing and we are happy, especially because we have started to break even,” Tshabalala said.
Zama Luthuli, the IDC’s executive for corporate affairs, said the corporation will continue to play a meaningful role in transforming the economic landscape of South Africa by supporting rural businesses and youth-owned enterprises. “We are encouraged by enterprises that create sustainable jobs in rural communities, and it’s more compelling when the business has initiatives that seek to empower workers, such as in the case with SiyaBuddy,” Luthuli said.
