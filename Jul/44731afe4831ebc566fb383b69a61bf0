 MALALANE – Early morning joggers and cyclists were warned to stay away from the Malelane Golf Club and Riverside farm after two lions were spotted strolling next to the tar road. Police officers reportedly saw the lions before 03:00 this morning and the Mpumalanga Tourism and Parks Agency (MTPA) was notified.

They are being monitored and the MTPA is aiming to dart the animals to take them back to the Kruger Park. Residents were being urged to stay away from the area to allow MTPA members to do their work. A young leopard was also seen on the gravel road behind the Dumuzulu workshops. Residents suspect it is the same one that recently roamed Leopard Creek.
