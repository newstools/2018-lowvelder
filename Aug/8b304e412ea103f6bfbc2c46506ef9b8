 MBOMBELA – Get ready to wear your crown and your hook on August 24 for this year’s Night of 1000 Stars. The theme for the evening is Princesses and Pirates and with a photo booth and an auction, it promises to be fun for the whole family. To suit the theme there will be a pirate punch and a princess potion available – so do not forget your cash if you want a sip or two of these two signature drinks. Guests can look forward to great live entertainment right through the evening including a performance by the popular band Wolwedans.
