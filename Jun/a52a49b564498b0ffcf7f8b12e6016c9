 MBOMBELA – According to National Prosecuting Authority spokesman Monica Nyuswa, Jaco Jordaan appeared in court on April 26. She said the alleged crimes were committed around the Kriel and Secunda area between 2013 and 2017. “It is alleged that the man is accused of running a Ponzi scheme and defrauding people who had retired to invest half of their pension money, which amounted to around R100 million.”
She added that it was alleged that he, under false pretenses, promised them that they will receive double what they had invested. “When the time agreed for the people to receive their payouts with interest as promised came, the accused was nowhere to be found and subsequently cases of fraud by different individuals were opened against him.” Also read: Local muso in ICU after collision that claimed tourist’s life Jordaan was first arrested on February 26 and appeared in the Secunda Regional Court. One of the complainants against Jordaan, Ronnie Smith, said he had informed all the other investors to open cases. “Some people invested over  R3 million and lost everything.” Smith said in Secunda, Jordaan had applied for bail twice, but was denied. “We have fought to keep him in jail and somehow he went past us and the system. Nobody notified us regarding this.” Nyuswa could not confirm exactly how many people had opened cases. She explained that Jordaan approached the High Court to review the procedure followed by the Regional Court in denying his applications. Jordaan was granted R50 000 bail. She said there were conditions. “This is that he does not interfere with state witnesses until the case is finalised. He had to surrender his passport to the investigating officer and report to the police on a daily basis.” She said the matter was still under investigation. Jordaan’s next appearance in court will be on June 6 in the Secunda Regional Court.
