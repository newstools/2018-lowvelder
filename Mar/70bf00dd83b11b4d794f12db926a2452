 They, however, have no intent of doing so. CRC chairman and SRC treasurer Wandile Shabangu said that they will not leave. “We are not moving. The university is our home. The police can come and drag us out but we will not move,” he said. “I know of three of our students who have been rushed to hospital after being shot by the police’s rubber bullets,” Shabangu confirmed. “That is why we must continue to fight.” SRC chairman and CRC vice-chairman Mxolisi Ncgamphalala addressed the students at a mass meeting after the gates were busted open.  He demanded that vice-chancellor prof Thoko Mayekiso and the rest of the university management must step down. The protests began on Monday when university students demanded that the university pay for the outside service providers and accommodation of the students.
