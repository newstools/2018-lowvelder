The 65m high Mac-Mac Falls in the Mac-Mac River is a declared national monument. This waterfall was originally a single stream, but in an attempt to work the rich gold-bearing reef over which it plunges, gold miners blasted it with dynamite to divert the river. You can also take the “Waterfall Tour” which includes the Berlin Falls, Bridal Veil Falls, Horseshoe Falls, Lisbon Falls, Lone Creek Falls and Maria Shires Falls. This tour is approximately 100km and shows the best waterfalls in this old gold-mining region. Situated along the escarpment of the Drakensberg Mountains, this region has the highest density of waterfalls in southern Africa.
