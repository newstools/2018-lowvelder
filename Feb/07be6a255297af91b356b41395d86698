MBOMBELA – Protesting workers were seen going through the wards of Rob Ferreira Hospital this morning. Nurses and staff went on a strike following instructions from the union, Nehawu. A patient reported seeing protesters allegedly harassing nurses to leave their stations and join the strike.  Department of Health spokesman Dumisane Malamule said the strikers would stand down as they had established an interim agreement with the union. “We will meet today at 15:00 to find out what their grievances are.” He said the situation in the meantime would return to normal.
