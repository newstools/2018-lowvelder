 MBOMBELA – The recent A+ Students National Championships showcased 645 math geniuses competing at five venues across the country. Lowveld competitors also had a chance to show their worth at a recent competition held at Bundu Lodge. Pupils from Mbombela, Malalane, Komatipoort, White River and Hazyview, along with other Mpumalanga towns, all came together to take part. Miley du Preez won silver. “It was a day filled with excitement. All the hard work and practice was demonstrated in the form of three abacus and three anzan (mental arithmetic) exam papers,” said Monique Hendrikse, from the Nelspruit/White River A+ Students Genius Mathematics centre.

Nathan Smit won silver. She added that a competition like this is good for children, as it helps them to learn that it is not always the best or the brightest who are successful, but rather those who work hard and stick with it. “When done right, competition can help your children learn skills they’ll use throughout their lives,” Hendrikse said.
