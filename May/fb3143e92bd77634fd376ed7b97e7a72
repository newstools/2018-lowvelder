 KAAPMUIDEN – SAPS spokesman Sgt Gerald Sedibe said police had sent the case for prosecution but it was sent back for further investigation. “We are ensuring that we cover all angles of this case before proceeding.” The two men were killed on Boondocks Farm near Low’s Creek on October 24. Von Johnston and Ntimane were shot at the gate to the farm. Sources stated that the autopsy showed Von Johnston had a gunshot wound to the head and numerous others to his body. Ntimane was shot in the back of the head. Sedibe initially confirmed that a man had handed himself over to police shortly after the incident. He claimed that he had been attacked by the victims. Von Johnston’s neighbour, Mark Norris (39), spent the night of the incident in police custody. He arrived at the Barberton Magistrate’s Court the next morning in the back of a police vehicle after a visit to a doctor and was escorted to the holding cells. Norris was released without appearing in court or being charged.
