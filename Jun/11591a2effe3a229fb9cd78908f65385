 Mr and Miss Teen Mbombela were crowned to great applause at Canary Walk Mall on Saturday. Contestants gave it their best shot and looked spectacular on the day, and along with the onlookers, guests and parents enjoyed themselves thoroughly. The event, which was hosted by Royal Pearls and HMT Model and Talent, aims to make modelling dreams come true.  Daleen Hillicks from HMT Model and Talent explained the criteria for the winning duo; “We were looking for teenagers that are comfortable in their own skin as well as language, and the contenders could answer their questions in English, Afrikaans or siSwati.  We wanted a role model and a voice for young South Africans, an ambassador living in Mbombela and surrounds.” ALSO READ:Rampant models run away with accolades The contestants were well received, despite being extremely nervous, especially in some cases.
