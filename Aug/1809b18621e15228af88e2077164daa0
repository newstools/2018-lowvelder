 Kevin Walton (motorcycles pre-1960), Gavin Walton (motorcycles post-1961), Maggie and Pat Whelan (cars – sealed ODO) and Schalk and Susan van Niekerk (cars – open ODO) were the stars of this long weekend in Hazyview. Not even cold, misty and rainy weather over the three days could deter enthusiasts of classic vehicles from the Lowveld’s scenery and mountain passes. The three-day Spider Rally was also the 50th anniversary rally of the Southern African Veteran and Vintage Association (SAVVA) and hosted by fellow motoring enthusiasts Willem and Edna Fick at Hotel Numbi and Garden Suites. Vehicles manufactured before December 31, 1997 were eligible to participate in the event organised by the Pretoria Old Motor Club. On Thursday a distance of approximately 300km was travelled, on Friday also about 300km and Saturday 200km was covered.
