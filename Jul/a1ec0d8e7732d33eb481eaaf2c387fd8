 MBOMBELA – Around 100 executives slept rough, at least by their standards, with just a piece of cardboard as a mattress to ward off the night’s close-to-zero temperatures. Ndimande, known as one of the provinces’ best netball umpires, not only contributed to charity but also to faced the fear of what the homeless have to go through night after night sleeping on the streets.  “I have been wanting to be part of the movement for a very long time. I was fortunate enough to be only one of three members out of 1 000 IDC employees to form part of this initiative,” said Ndimande. From 18:00 to 06:00 they lived out the night, with soup, a cardboard box and a bit of wood. “I did not get any sleep. By 03:00 the fire was out and we were all freezing to death. It is an experience that I do not want to relive. It changed my mentality on how I look at things in life. I thank God for everything in my life and I must not take life for granted as it can be taken away from you in minutes.” Bernard ‘Benny’ Ndimande was part of The SleepOut Movement. Around 100 executives were part of the movement. The executives were taken for a tour of Lilliesleaf, once the nerve centre of the liberation movement and a place of refuge for its leaders.
