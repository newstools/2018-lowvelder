 MBOMBELA – Fun was had both in and out of the classroom when the grade eight pupils of Penryn College recently made toys from recycled materials and then donated them to less-fortunate children. This formed part of their life orientation curriculum in environmental health. “We address environmental health and the responsibility that we have to recycle,” said the head of life orientation at Penryn College, Rowena Spratt. The concept surrounded the importance of promoting recycling and how recycled materials can be of use to those less fortunate.
On May 29 the learners visited Penreach ECD’s target centre, Blessing Creche in Mataffin, to deliver their self-made projects.
The delivery of the toys not only exposed the learners to different learning environments, but also expanded their imaginations in creating pieces with recycled material. bdr They took the opportunity to demonstrate the development skills that can be acquired for each toy to the practitioners of Blessing Creche. Quantitative skills, literacy abilities, as well as assisting in differentiating between shapes and colours and telling time were a few of the objectives behind the toys. “This project was aimed to spread the joy of gaining knowledge and skills, which in turn will give individuals power over their future,” said Miguel dos Reis Delgado, head of community service on the Penryn College executive committee. Creche manager Marium Matebula expressed her gratitude to the Penryn College pupils. “Such a small gesture and the children’s faces are priceless,” she said.
