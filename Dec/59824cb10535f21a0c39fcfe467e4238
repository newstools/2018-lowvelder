 MBOMBELA –  The man who was stabbed stated he was driving towards the centre when another man blocked the road with his car. “He started shouting at me and I shouted back at him. Then I drove off and I parked my car at the centre. My girlfriend went into the store. While I was waiting in my car the man appeared. He attacked me with his key and stabbed me in my arm.  He then went off jogging like nothing happened.” Emer-G-Med’s Martin Jeffrey said they treated the patient at the scene. “He had three stab wounds to his arm. We transported him to Mediclinic Nelspruit for treatment.” Police spokesman Capt Zandile Gwaqa said a case of crimen injuria was opened against the man who had been stabbed. “He said the man had called him a f*****g moron.” The stab victim told Lowvelder he would be opening a case against his alleged attacker today.
