 I’m lecturing myself here. It has been due for quite a while. I am nothing without my community. My name is _________ and I am a Mombelan. Your name is ____________ and you are a Bloemfonteiner. His name is ___________ and he is a Rustenburger. Have you ever heard the saying ‘no man is an island?’ According to the online community, this is a quotation from poet John Donne. Some excerpts: “No man is an island entire of itself; every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main; 
 “any man’s death diminishes me, because I am involved in mankind.” I’ve made the mistake of thinking that I was an island. This is never done intentionally, but I’m sure you have also done it – you focus so hard at the task at hand that you and up isolating yourself from those who support you; from those who enable you to perform any task at all. As community journalists, we exist because of and for the sake of our communities. Our days are woven from the fibres that are our neighbours, our friends, their likes, dislikes, triumphs, tragedies, laughs, tears and needs. Our days, in turn, weave our careers. Our passion is our people. Our careers are an incidental consequence. There are times when we, too, lose direction. We get caught up in a rat race of sorts. I am sure that this happens to doctors, teachers, mechanics, salesmen and everyone in between. This is why we have communities to ground and protect us. Cities are subdivided into wonderfully caring smaller suburbs where a feeling of community is palpable. I am lucky to be a Mbombelan. It means that there is always a mentor who pulls me back to reality and reminds me why I am here when I lose perspective. I hope to gain maturity so that this will no longer be necessary. But until then, I know that I am not alone. Communities like ours remind us that we are not here for ourselves, but for the collective experience of this wonderful thing called life. We are here to make a difference, to pay it forward and to plough back the grace and goodness we have been given. Nothing that any of us achieve is the result of our own greatness. One of my lecturers always said that we stand on the shoulders of giants. Every community has giants that deserve to be recognised, honoured and applauded. It is these people that build local heroes. It is these people that pull me down to earth when I need to be set straight. Take a moment to appreciate your community and the role you are meant to play in it. Embrace that role – be it the role of a dentist, music teacher, lawyer or a community journalist like my colleagues and I. Do what you do to the best of your ability and encourage your neighbour to do the same. That way, our communities will keep making South Africa the wonderful place it is.
