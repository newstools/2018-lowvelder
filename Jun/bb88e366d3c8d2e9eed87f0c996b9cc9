 MBOMBELA – Hunger eventually led to the wayward young male lion loose in the area successfully being darted and captured not far from where it was first spotted. Juan de Beer, acting senior manager of the MTPA’s Wildlife Protection Services, confirmed this morning that the lion was seen again, this time after killing a cow near the Long Tom Pas’s on the R37. The MTPA was informed and veterinarian Dr Ferreira du Plessis and carnivore scientist Gerrie Camacho went in search for it. Although the young male hid in thick bushes, they managed to dart it successfully. Watch a video taken by volunteers who were involved in the capturing:  Upon examining the animal, they found some slight injuries, hence it was transported to a rehabilitation facility first. It will also be tested for TB. Once fully recuperated, they will decide where it would be released again.  Drone video by Des Jacobs Lowvelders were kept on their toes for almost a week after the sighting of the young male lion on the R37 was first reported about 20 kilometres from Sabie, on the pass. Earlier reports, even accompanied by a photo of the “darted” lion, were soon proofed as fake. Read previous reports here.
