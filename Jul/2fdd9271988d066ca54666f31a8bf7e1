 MBOMBELA – The outreach for local educators was organised by Meridian Karino, in conjunction with Innibos and Canary Walk Mall. The programme focused on the art curriculum and teachers learned skills to teach different forms of art more successfully in the classroom. They moved the venue for this year’s workshop to Canary Walk Mall to make it more easily accessible for all who participated.  The day was full of fun, educational activities. It aimed to empower them to teach pupils in the foundation, intermediate, senior and FET phases. Teachers participated in various workshops which offered unique and rich content. According to Helena van Jaarsveld, who started the art workshops in 2015, the main purpose was to create a balance between teaching and learning. “I noticed how teachers struggled in the classroom. Most of the time they don’t have time. They work according to a timetable. If you have free time, they would ask you to teach arts irrespective of whether you like it or not. These workshops are very helpful to them. From here they will be able to go to class and demonstrate to learners how to do certain artwork,” said Van Jaarsveld.  Sonto Nyathi, a subject advisor in the Mpumalanga Department of Education, said that since the inception of the workshops there has been a huge improvement in this area of education. “Visual arts is very important at schools. It is now on the level of math, science and technology,” she said.
