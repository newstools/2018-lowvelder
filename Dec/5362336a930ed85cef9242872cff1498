 MBOMBELA – Joseph Mabuza was mourned by friends, family and colleagues at a memorial service that was held on Thursday. Mabuza, a senior communications manager at the Department of Community Safety, Security and Liaison (DCSSL), passed away on December 23 after a collision occurred between a motorbike he was travelling on and a bakkie. The vehicle allegedly made a U-turn on the N4 towards Mozambique just before the Nkomazi toll gate, the DCSSL said in a statement on Sunday. The driver of the bakkie allegedly fled the scene. A case of culpable homicide has been opened but provincial police spokesman, Brig. Leonard Hlati, confirmed on Wednesday that no arrests have been made.
