The World Knowledge Olympiad is a long-standing national olympiad for Grade 6 to 12 learners. For almost 30 years, it has attracted bright and curious young minds who are self-starters wanting to know more about the world around them. This year it took place on May 17 with each candidate sitting the paper at their own school. The question papers were received from the World Knowledge Olympiad and only opened by teachers on the day of the exam. Afterwards they were returned to the World Knowledge Olympiad for marking. The paper consisted of 50 general questions. His results were announced on Friday by the principal of the school, Jacques Janse van Rensburg. “In our school he got the highest points and took first place,” Janse van Rensburg said. Joshua said that to improve his knowledge he reads a lot and watches the news. “When my parents watch news I also watch, and I learn a lot of interesting things. Over the past days I watched news about what is happening in Zimbabwe. It is bad news and it is depressing.” ALSO READ:St Peter’s Primary School grade 1’s continue a 60-year tradition Des van Wyk, the school’s head of academics and English teacher, said Joshua is mature for his age.His choir and hockey coach, Jason Blockley said that he also performs well in sports. “He is in the first hockey team.
