MBOMBELA –   This came to light during the monthly Community Police Forum, which was held at the Mbombela municipality last night. Station commander Brig Prince Hlupheka Ngobeni said a man, who was from out of town, had gone looking for a toilet in a building where the sex workers resided in the city. “He said the woman held him and forcefully raped him.  Afterwards when they let him go,  they demanded he go and get money to pay them.” He said the man did not have money, so he had to go ask his wife for the money. This is when it was reported to the police. He added that the police took all matters reported to them seriously and he himself accompanied the members to arrest the prostitues. The sex workers remain in custody.
