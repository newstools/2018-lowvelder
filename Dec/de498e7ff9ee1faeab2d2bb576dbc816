KOMATIPOORT – Last night one fatality was reported at the bridge after a person who exited from a taxi was run over by a truck. According to Dept of Safety and Security Moeti Mmusi, the situation was currently normalised and was operating optimally. Yesterday, traffic gridlocked for the better part of the day as motorists traveling to Mozambique occupied all the lanes, leaving no space for on coming traffic.  Department MEC  Pat Ngomane and Provincial police commissioner Gen Mondli Zuma brought more officials to correct the situation as the people became unruly. The queues covered a distance of approximately 14 kilometers to the border on the N4 and Coppersdaal roads respectively.
