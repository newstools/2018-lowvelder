 Penryn and Uplands know no other way than to fight tooth and nail for bragging rights in their annual winter sports derby. Penryn hosted the first leg of the derby this past weekend, but their home-ground advantage did not mean much as they floundered in almost all the clashes. On the Friday, rain resulted in most of netball games being cancelled. The u/15 and u/16 B teams, however, managed to conclude their games, which ended on a high note for Uplands which won both. The former only lost by one point, but the gap in the u/16 match was significantly bigger with a 22-2 defeat. Uplands u/14 A, U/16 A and second boys’ hockey teams also reigned supreme, but the u/16 B boys’ game ended in draw. The former won 3-1, the u/16 A team, 3-0 and the second team, 2-1. The chess games between the two schools ended in a draw, but Uplands went on to win the quiz and the debate. The weather cleared up on Saturday and the rest of the derby could continue without any hiccups. On the hockey field, all but four games ended in a victory for Uplands, and those four in a draw. Penryn’s biggest defeat was suffered by the u/16 A team, with the game ending with six goals against the 0 of Penryn. Furthermore, their second team lost 3-1, their u/14 B side 4-2, and their u/14 A team 3-2. The schools’ u/15 Bs both scored two goals, with the same result in the u/15 A game. Neither of the u/16 B teams were able to score a goal, resulting in a 0-0 draw. In a real nail-biter, the first teams both scored three goals, the game also ending in a draw. The home team only managed to win one game on the rugby field, with the u/14s clenching a 23-10 win. The u/16’s game ended in a 31-31 draw and Uplands’ u/15s beat Penryn 33-8. Uplands’ second team won 33-5. Up until the last few minutes Penryn’s first team had a real chance of winning the clash. But the wheels came off due to bad decisions in their own half, leading to forced errors and eventually points on the scoreboard. Uplands opened the sluices and the clash ended in a 33-22 victory.
