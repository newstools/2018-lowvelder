 MBOMBELA – The provincial police commissioner of Mpumalanga, Lieutenant General Mondli Zuma recently issued a warning to shoppers to be cautious during tomorrow’s Black Friday. Shoppers are advised to be vigilant and careful on the day as they are not the only ones excited about the sales, but opportunistic criminals who are looking to grab money and other valuables during the rush. Be wary of your surroundings at all times as large crowds of people tend to draw criminal elements. Look out for individuals that may be following. “What is also critical is that you must avoid carrying large sums of cash as criminals will be setting their sight on malls and shopping centres,” Zuma said.
