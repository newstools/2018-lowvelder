 MBOMBELA – On Saturday Danté van Heerden made a generous food donation to the Nelspruit SPCA. Danté said she loves animals and wants to help them wherever she can. She heard they were struggling and decided to organise a collection drive at her school, Curro Nelspruit.  Danté van Heerden and Marcelle Hofman. “We need food for all dog sizes as well as puppy food! We also need food for adult cats and kittens. We have 57 dogs and 40 cats in our kennels, as well as several feral cat colonies to feed,” the post said.
Marcelle Hofman, kennel inspector at the Nelspruit SPCA, said they use good, quality food for their animals.  “Unfortunately we need specific foods for specific animals. When we have puppies, I can’t give them adult food and I also can’t feed a Great Dane with the same amount of food as a Jack Russell.” On Saturday a poker charity series as well as Nelspruit Concerned Citizens made a sizeable food donation to the SPCA. “Thank you so much for the amazing donations and for being so concerned about our animals,” the SPCA said. “We have an abundance of animals to feed and we don’t want to have our animals going to bed with an empty stomach,” Hofman said. Any donations can be made at the Nelspruit SPCA at 6 Meidlinger Street. For more information on how you can donate, phone 013-753-3582.
