 Riders from the Lowveld Riding Club enjoyed a horse-riding fun day at Cést la Vie Stables on Saturday.
It was organised by Anita van Eeden and Jakes Jacobs. Everyone who wanted to participate was welcome to attend. Van Eeden said the day was organised to give everyone a break from regular shows and from life in general. “It is an opportunity to have fun and go crazy.”  Even though this was a fun day, it tested the riders’ horsemanship and the ability to guide their horse through an unknown pattern successfully.

We had five different games; the cable stitch obstacle course, egg-and-spoon horsemanship, musical cones, ross’ run and big z. All the riders walked away with a prize.”  The overall winners were, Lilian Verdoes on Samurai took first place. In second place it was JJ Jacobs on Ovideus and Tainya Büser on Baron took third place.
