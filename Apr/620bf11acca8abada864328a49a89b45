 MBOMBELA – Barry Odendaal, SUPERSPAR’s spokesman, said The Grove makes a donation to a local charity every month. “We have a list of charities that we support and our customers get to vote for who we should support that particular month. They then make donations which we match and hand over to the charity in question.” Barry Odendaal and Adrian Michael unload the truck. Ludi Botha, vice-chairman of the board, was happy with the donation but said there is still so much to be done at the SPCA. “Our food levels look better, but we still do not have enough. We are also struggling financially and we have salaries to pay.”  In aid of its financial crisis, the organisation will host an SPCA Saturday tomorrow. Adrian Michael, Nobuhle Sdumo, Joseph Mathebula and Bernard Phiri. “We will have stalls and a speaker on emotional-support dogs and how to train your dog to help others,” Botha said. The public can also bring their canines to be dipped every Saturday at the SPCA.  All donations are welcome. You can contact Botha on 078 702 2201 for more information.
