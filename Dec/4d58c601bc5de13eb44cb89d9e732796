 This reminds me of the movie Home Alone. The movie is about a troublesome eight-year-old Kevin McCallister (Macaulay Culkin), who is left behind by his family when they go on holiday. Make sure you do not become like the McCallisters.  Here is a list of things to remember before leaving for your family vacation: 1. Check your bags. Make sure you take all your bags before leaving, since you might leave behind the most important bag that has all your clothes or medication.
2. Create a to-do list. After you do what is in the list, tick it off, then you will know what you still have to do.
3. Unplug all unnecessary electrical appliances. Protect your home from possible power surges or fire, as when you are away there might be electricity issues. You will also save money by switching off some things.
4. Lock all your doors and windows and contact your alarm company. Check again before you leave and make sure the alarm company knows that thereâ€™s no one in the house.  5.Take your car for a roadworthiness inspection. Make sure the tyres and brakes are in good working order. Do not forget to check the spare wheel as well.
6. Before you get into the car, make sure everyone is the car. Remember Home Alone? Source: Outsurance
