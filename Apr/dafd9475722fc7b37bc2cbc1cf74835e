YouTube videos were her tutors and her kitchen table her workspace although she now moved into the carport of their home. Going back to the natural beauty that surrounds Sabie, Le Roux explains that as an environmentalist – by profession and heart – her work is mainly inspired by nature. “Some of the pouring artworks end up being backgrounds for a nature scene, while others look like something from outer space or under water,” she said.

Sixty will be shortlisted and these will form part of an exhibition to be held in Mbombela during the Innibos Festival from June 24 to 30. There will also be an awards evening on June 24, at which the winners will be announced. There is no entry fee.
