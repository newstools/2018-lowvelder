 MBOMBELA – A 39-year-old reaction officer of ACS narrowly escaped death, when he was shot inches from his heart during a
call-out on Wednesday night. UPDATE: R538 to Numbi Gate still closed due to protests
Sabelo Mashabane, who has been with ACS for almost two years, was responding to an alarm in Van Rensburg Street at about 22:00, when in between patrols, an unknown suspect shot him.
“I was trying to help,” he told relationship manager of ACS, John Meintjies. Mashabane also said, while reporting the incident on ACS’ internal communication channel, that he urgently needed help and that he was busy dying.
The bullet hit Mashabane about two inches below his collarbone, entered through his chest, penetrated his lung and exited through his back causing heavy damage to his ribs. The bullet narrowly missed Mashabane’s heart. “Above all, he drove himself to hospital,” said Meintjies. While he was with the reaction officer, shortly after he was admitted to Rob Ferreira Hospital, his lung collapsed. “I admit that I thought we were going to lose him, but he’s a fighter and above all expectations pulled through,” Meintjies said.
As soon as Mashabane was stabilised at Rob Ferreira, he was transferred to Mediclinic Nelspruit where he is recovering well. What is more, he is expected to be discharged within the next 48 hours. Hope found by road users as R536 roadworks begin “We are extremely relieved and grateful that Sabelo is stable and doing well. Thank you to everyone for the support and messages. Thank you to Mediclinic staff for caring so well for our brother in arms,” said Menitjies.
The details surrounding the incident remain vague. This is an ongoing investigation and according Meintjies, they will wait until Mashabane has recuperated to such an extent that he will be able to provide more details about what happened.
