 “The  Lotto sits at an estimated R100 million, a record-breaking amount for Ithuba,” says Khensani Mabuza, head of marketing at Ithuba National Lottery. “We are very excited as this is in keeping with our promise to our players of bigger jackpots more often and we are calling on all South Africans to go out and play,” she says. The highest Lotto jackpot payouts since 2015 are as follows:  “We recently announced a PowerBall winner of just over R70 million,” says Mabuza. “In 2016, we paid out our highest PowerBall jackpot amount of R87 million to a school teacher in Limpopo. Ithuba is now looking at making the same happen for our Lotto players.” “You can only win if you play, so visit our National Lottery website, or the banking channels and National Lottery retailers, and change your tomorrow today!” concludes Mabuza.
