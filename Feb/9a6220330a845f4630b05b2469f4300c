 Young and old came together at the i’langa Mall Ice Rink for the start of this year’s Academy on Ice on January 31. According to Glenda Slabbert, skating administrator and figure skating coach, the academy, a first for the region, caters to all ages and all skill levels. “To some it might be a good way of learning something new and spending some social time, for others especially the younger skaters this might lead to developing a preference for skating and then they might choose to formally pursue figure skating or ice hockey,” she said.

The sessions, which run for an hour either on Wednesday or Saturday evenings are facilitated by a dedicated team of local skaters who have all been vetted by Slabbert who has more than 20 years’ experience in ice and figure skating. “Because there aren’t many professional skaters in Mbombela, we have gotten together a team of people who are more than able to hold their own and instruct newcomers,” she said. According to a proud grandmother of two eager young skaters, Sunita de Beer it makes sense to bring her grandsons to the academy as it offers them a new challenge and something else to focus their energy and attention on.

The next evening will be hosted on Saturday at the i’langa Mall Ice Rink at 18:00. Also read: Lowveld High lads focus on skating to aid CANSA
