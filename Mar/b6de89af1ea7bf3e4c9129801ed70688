 MSHOLOZI – Mama Esther’s Safe Haven in Msholozi did not cease operations by February 28, as instructed by the Gauteng High Court division, seated in Mbombela, on January 29. Social development spokesman, Petunia Lessing, said late on Wednesday they still had to remove 13 children remaining at the centre. “The department, through its social workers, visited the centre to assess and remove the children to alternative centres, but was prevented from doing so by Nkosi and some community members who expressed concerns about the fact that the centre is closing down.” READ MORE: Mama Esther associates threaten journalist Lessing said only one child out of 14 was removed.
