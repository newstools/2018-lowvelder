 MBOMBELA – The Gauteng High Court division, seated in Mbombela, ruled on January 29 that Mama Esther’s Safe Haven in Msholozi must cease operations by February 28. The court also ordered Nkosi not to admit any more children to the centre. Department spokesman, Petunia Lessing, said she missed the initial deadline of February 2, but Nkosi has since been provided with a copy of the court order. The department needs it to place the children in other places of safety. It is unclear exactly how many children live at the centre, but it is believed to be 80 or 81. “We as the department are relieved that finally the children will be protected,” she told Lowvelder. “We have nothing against her, we are just concerned about the centre now following the laws and regulations.” She explained that the DSD became involved with the centre last year, and initially Nkosi agreed that it remove some children. Nkosi then approached the court claiming the department removed them unlawfully.
