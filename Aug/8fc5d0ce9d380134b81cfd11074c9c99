 The Transvaal Scottish, Witwatersrand Rifles, SA Irish and Regiment Botha exercised their rights to fly their colours in the town’s streets and marched to the beat of the SA Irish Pipes and Drums Band from Durban. The parade also featured Swazi traditional groups. A sunset parade was held in the Garden of Remembrance. This was followed by a formal dinner, hosted by Regiment Botha, in the Moth Hall. This event was held to remember all the soldiers, both men and women of all races, who trained in Barberton and fought in World War II.

Major Terry O’Halloran thanked those who attended the event. “Thanks also goes to the local Moths from Lone Tree Shellhole, who have undertaken to keep the garden of remembrance clean,” he said. The parade concluded with a military vehicle parade past the memorial. The annual event is held on the last Saturday of August, and there are plans to make it even bigger and better next year.
