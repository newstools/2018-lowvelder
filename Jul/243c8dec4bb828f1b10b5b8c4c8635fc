 Members of the public, particularly landowners, are advised to be extra careful and assure their fire control measures are ready.  Wildfires, if not reported early can result in great devastation. It is very important that communities be vigilant. People should report any signs of fires to their local fire authorities and fire protection associations, bearing in mind that delays have disastrous effects, as wildfires spread within minutes. Sometimes, fires occur naturally, ignited by heat from the sun or a lightning strike. However, the majority of wildfires are the result of human carelessness. This can cause a property to burn to the ground, destroying the environment and most importantly, lives can be lost. In order to stay alert WoF together with various Fire Protection Associations (FPAs) have placed more than 500 firefighters with specialised firefighting training on standby operation, to offer any additional ground and aerial firefighting support in different parts of Mpumalamga. Between June-July 2018, 79 fires have been extinguished throughout the province, with an estimation of 1 000 hectares of land burnt, these include plantation and grassland fires. According to Maseko from WoF, the 2018 winter fire season threatens to be challenging, this is as a result of the ongoing drought experienced across the country.
