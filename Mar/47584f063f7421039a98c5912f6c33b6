 MBOMBELA – Bossies Community Justice (BCJ) has more than 1 000 users on its new, free, user-friendly phone app for the community. It was designed and created for the organisation by Christiaan van der Merwe, Lowveld Hospital’s IT specialist. Since its launch last month, BCJ’s Albert Gryvenstein confirmed that they had received positive feedback from community members who are using it. The app was designed not to compete with security companies. “It is free and easy to use for the community,” said Gryvenstein.  He said it was not a security company alarm system or panic button. People can use it if they do not have a security company. “Bossies is about information and support, and this app will have contact information at your fingertips.” It can be downloaded from Google Play Store. Simply search for BCJustice. Once downloaded, the first page shows the contact telephone numbers for BCJ’s Albert Gryvenstein and Danie Theron. The contact information can be accessed without having data on your phone.  Gryvenstein added that once a person contacts them via the app, a geographical location is sent to their phones. “This helps us if anyone is in need of assistance, especially on farms and plots. We can immediately get their location. We urge members of the community not to merely send their location, as this does not inform us about the nature of the emergency. “People register on the app so we immediately get their contact details and know who they are.” It has a list of emergency numbers for police, the fire department and several emergency services. There is also a display of several doctors and specialists in the area. The page also gives you the latest news from the area. “This is just to inform people if certain places are having protests, for example, or if major storms are expected, thereby helping them avoid any incidents.”
