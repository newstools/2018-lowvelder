 International Cat Day originated in 2002. It was created by the  International Fund for Animal Welfare as a way for people to honour their feline friends. It is a day when people can go to their local animal shelter and rescue a cat from being put down.  You can celebrate by supporting local shelters in their endeavours to protect and honour these beautiful creatures. Nelspruit SPCA This shelter has a love of cats. To prove this it has launched a feral cat project where it feeds 14 kittens and 140 cats in the area. According to SPCA vice-chairman, Ludi Botha, they use about 43 kilograms of cat food per week. “We always welcome new volunteers to help feed and trap cats so that we can vaccinate and possibly sterelise them,” Botha said. They have tons of cute cats up for adoption. Contact 013-753-3582 for more information.

According to Pro-Life founder Karin Erasmus, the public is welcome at their establishment any time to play with the cats or pamper them a bit.  You can also adopt a feline from this shelter. “They are not very messy animals and do not need potty training. You also do not need to bathe them as the lick themselves clean,” Erasmus said.
