 The sun beat down on the young Heidel Eggs Cook-Off contestants last Saturday as they strutted their stuff over gas stoves in an outdoor kitchen. The gloriously warm winterâ€™s day was perfect for the event, and Bagdad Centre was abuzz with people and visitors from all over.

Eggs being beaten and chocolate slowly melting vied with the delicious aromas of frying onion and tomato.

The end results were superb, both in presentation and flavour. Judges included Simon Sutherland from The Winkler Hotel, Koos Vermeulen (Koos Kook) and Pieter Malan from Blueprint.
