 MALALANE – Tourists and locals are urged to be vigilant against criminals when parking on the bridge at the Kruger National Park’s Malelane Gate. Last Thursday, tourists lost all of their valuables when criminals ransacked their vehicle while they were taking in the views and animal-spotting. This is not the first time criminals have taken advantage of an unattended vehicle. In May 2016, a local student’s valuables were stolen from her vehicle while she was taking photos for a project nearby. Mel Preddy, of the local community policing forum, said that they suspect that a specific gang, who targets tourist hot spots, is responsible for the recent incident. He warned that people should take extra care when visiting attractions in the area. Vehicles should never be left unlocked or unattended, and valuables should be stowed out of sight. Strangers that approach you should also be treated with caution and any suspicious activity should immediately be reported either to the establishment’s security or local authorities.
