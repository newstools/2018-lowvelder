 MBOMBELA – Over the past month this newspaper has repeatedly reported how trucks, buses and even an ambulance could be seen overtaking others on solid white lines.

On March 28 at around 12:45, the witness was travelling on the R37 from Burgersfort towards Lydenburg when a flatbed truck overtook him and a minibus driving in front of him.  When another truck could be seen approaching in the oncoming lane, the truck returned to his own. He then promptly attempted to overtake a line of three vehicles, still on a solid line and approaching a curve in the road.  Finally he succeeded in overtaking a small delivery truck, a car towing a caravan and a larger truck.  Edward de Jager, director of JMC Transport to which the truck is registered, agreed that such reckless driving was totally unacceptable. “I can assure you that an investigation will take place and the necessary disciplinary action will be taken against the driver of the vehicle at that time.” The same witness also had an opportunity to photograph a similar incident the day before, on March 27. At around 09:15 he was driving on the Long Tom Pass in the direction of Lydenburg when he saw another driver illegally overtaking another truck on a solid white line.  Peter Charls from CTB Farming, which operates the trailer, similarly promised that action would be taken against the driver. “We take any such action by our drivers very seriously and will not tolerate any such behaviour,” he told Lowvelder. Coca-Cola has suspended a driver who was similarly caught, while City to City and the Mpumalanga Department of Health have promised to investigate their drivers for similar offences.
