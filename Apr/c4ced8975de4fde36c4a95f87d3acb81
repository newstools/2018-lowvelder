After the accident she had a broken pelvis and back. “She was well enough to go home and recuperate there,” said Mediclinic spokesman Robyn Baard. Melanie Kruger “We still have to take statements from both parties and we are not sure when this case will appear in court. We will also take statements from eyewitnesses and take them into account before we charge anybody.”
The Kruger family could not be reached for comment. Also read: BREAKING NEWS: Woman trapped in car following crash on Madiba Drive
