 MBOMBELA – With the summer approaching, Lowvelders not only have heat and sunshine to look forward to but also influx of snakes going into homes.

Anneke van Schoor with one of the snakes that she caught. “Just like all other animals, if you keep your distance and respect the snake, it will do the same to you,” said Anneke van Schoor, member of the MRR as well as professional snake handler. “Snakes are not aggressive, but they are defensive. If you try to attack the snake, it will defend itself,” van Schoor said.

These spaces provide warm (warmer than outside) places near or in the foundation wall for a snake to spend the winter. In spring, the snakes become active and re-emerge “So the idea is to seal the cracks and fill the holes during the summer when snakes are not using them. If the holes and cracks are filled while snakes are in the foundation, they may be forced to enter the house or die in the foundation,” Hobkirk said. He also suggests getting rid of their food source, mice and rats. Anneke’s daugher, Jolanda van Schoor, is also a registred snake catcher. ALSO READ: Help, there is a snake in my yard!
