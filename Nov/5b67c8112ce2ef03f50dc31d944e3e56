 MBOMBELA –  According to Weather SA forecaster Edward Engelbrecht, there are no warnings and nothing can be seen developing at this stage. “What we can see is the usual summertime rainfall at this stage which is expected at this time for the next week for the Mbombela area.” The South African Journal of Science had published a report named “Recent emergence of CAT5 tropical cyclones” by the University of Witwatersrand climate change researcher Dr Jennifer Fitchett who stated that category 5 tropical cyclones, the strongest category of storms, have only recently emerged in the South Indian Ocean. Since 1989, their frequency of occurrence has increased. This increase poses a heightened risk of storm damage for the South Indian Ocean island states and the countries of the southern African subcontinent as a result of the strong winds, heavy rainfall and storm surges associated with these storms, and the large radial extent at category 5 strength. Engelbrecht said for a CAT 5 storm to hit the country was extremely rare. “We do agree there is a change in weather conditions and there is an expectation of an increase in cyclones, but at this stage it is impossible to say when. But we will know a week in advance.”
