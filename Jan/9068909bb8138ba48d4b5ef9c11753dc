 MBOMBELA – Parents unable to pay their children’s school fees are eligible for relief from the department of education. According to Gerald Sambo, spokesman for the Mpumalanga department of education, parents who are unable to pay for their children’s fees can apply for an exemption with them through the school.  “No school is allowed to turn a learner away because of a parent’s inability to pay school fees,” says he says. “School fees are between the parents and the school, the learner’s education should never be affected,” he adds. The application can be done even after the pupil has been accepted at the school. “People’s circumstances change, by the time of the application, a parent might think they can afford their child’s fees and then their circumstances change after they have been accepted,” says Sambo.  With the application, parents must also submit supporting documents that the school will hand over to the circuit office. The application is later to the district office from where the matter is escalated. Full exemption is granted to quintal one to three students. These are from poor communities or disadvantaged backgrounds. Quintal four schools (former model C schools) get a partial exemption dependant on the family’s financial circumstances. School fees at Hoëskool Nelspruit (NHS)’s school fees for 2018 are R19 650 from last year R17 900. Boarding residence, on the other hand, costs R27 500. At Lowveld High School, the school fees for this year cost R19 118. Parents get a 4 per cent discount if they pay in advance as well as a R1 738 discount if paid by the end of February.  Boarding cost R36 000 if the learner stays weekly at the boarding school or R 51 000 if they are staying per term. Parents get five per cent discount is paid by the beginning of the year. Hoërskool Bergvlam, on the other hand cost R19 500. The exemption does not cover boarding fees. Those, according to the department, are settled by the parents.
