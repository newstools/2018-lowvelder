MBOMBELA – “I have been coming in here for three weeks and every time there is a problem with their computers,” said one person waiting in the queue. Staff members of the department announced this on a loud speaker while Lowvelder was present and apologised to the people waiting to be served and explained why there was a delay. DHA spokesman, Doris Chiloane said the problem was being sorted out in Pretoria. “We cannot tell when it will be online again. As soon as it is, we will continue to help. This is a huge frustration for us, Any company knows it is a nightmare when your server goes down.”
