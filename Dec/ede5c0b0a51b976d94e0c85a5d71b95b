The Mpumalanga Department of Public Works, Roads and Transport needs to do something. It is their responsibility, no one else’s,” added Mhlongo. He called the residents to make their voices heard. “When one of us raises our voice, it is easy for government to ignore us. But when hundreds of us raise our voices together, we are much harder to dismiss,” he said. Cyril Dlamini, department spokesman, said under normal circumstances for any safety measures to be installed in a provincial road the municipality will need to engage the department. He said traditional leaders and community leaders of an area have the right to approach public works. “The department will be then send a technical team to the area to do a feasible study on how they could assist,” said Dlamini.
