 BARBERTON – The situation at Barberton Department of Correctional Services (DCS) Maximum B has returned to normal, and the family day on Sunday will go ahead as planned. The area commissioner of Barberton management area, Solly Netshivhazwaulu, visited the offenders on Monday and addressed their grievances. Offenders on Monday refused to take their breakfast in protest of a new policy that has been put into effect by the DCS, which prohibits visitors bringing in items bought outside the prison. According to Mesiah Hlungwani, DCS spokesman, no hunger strike was recorded. He said the offenders had grievances which needed the attention of the management. “The area commissioner (Solly Netshivhazwaulu) and the offenders deliberated on the grievances and reached consensus on how the matter could be addressed before the family day,” said Hlungwani.

Visitors are only allowed to bring six units per item,” added Hlungwani. He said the management and offenders further agreed that no food will be allowed to enter any correctional centre. “So, visitors during family days and during routine visits may not bring anything consumable. The family day at Medium B is going on as planned on Sunday. Food will be sold inside,” continued Hlungwani. He said a Family Day is a privilege given to all well-behaved offenders, to meet with their friends, family members and loved ones. “This plays a critical role in reintegrating offenders back to the community, as the will be kept abreast of what is happening in their communities,” concluded Hlungwani.
