 As the country celebrates the 100th anniversary of Nelson Mandela’s birth this week, government honoured his life through various initiatives. Mpumalanga will commemorate the centenary of the icon with various initiatives, including a six-metre bronze statue that will be located in front of the legislature at Riverside Government Complex. The Loop Art Foundry will be responsible for sculpting the statue. The MEC of Culture, Sports and Recreation Thandi Shongwe said it will be unveiled during September. “All the activities of Mandela centenary celebrations are works in progress,” she said.
Shongwe said that they chose Mbombela as the area to place the statue, as it is is the capital city of Mpumalanga. “As such it would be appropriate to celebrate such an iconic centenary in the city.” ALSO READ:IN PICTURES: Lowveld Media celebrates Madiba Day The raising of the statue was announced for the first time last year by the former premier, now deputy president of the country, David Mabuza.
