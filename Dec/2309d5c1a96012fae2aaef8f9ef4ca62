What is violence against women and children? It takes many forms, for example: – Physical violence in the form of domestic violence, terrible violent crime such as murder, robbery, rape and assault.
– Emotional violence and trauma at many levels caused by many factors. Women and children in their homes, at work, at schools, on our streets, in our communities suffer this form of violence for various reasons.
