 Provincial National Prosecuting Authority spokesman Monica Nyuswa confirmed that Ngubane and his wife Angel, Edwin Makhabela and Cleopas Mahlalela from Takitsi Trading were found innocent in the Nelspruit Regional Court on charges of corruption. Defence advocate, Johan de Necker said the matter was discharged with no prima facie. “There has never been a bare minimum of evidence against them.” He said the case had had an emotional strain on them. They had handed themselves over to the police in October 2013 after they were requested to do so by the Hawks. They were charged with corruption relating to a tender that was awarded to Takitsi while Ngubane was acting HOD. He had filled the position in 2009 when Cogta came into being as a result of the former Department of Local Government and Housing splitting into the Department of Human Settlements and Cogta.
