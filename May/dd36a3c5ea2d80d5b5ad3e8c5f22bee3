 LYDENBURG – Local trout farmer, Cornel du Plessis (44), and his employee narrowly escaped with their lives on Tuesday afternoon when a Coca-Cola truck crashed into them. Du Plessis’ wife, Liezel, said her husband was taking an employee, David Rampela, to see a doctor in town after he had suffered a minor burn while burning firebreaks on their farm outside town. “They are okay,” she said. “It was a terrible accident. I am so grateful. It could have been so much worse.”   She said that they were entering Lydenburg from the Long Tom Pass when the truck hit them at the traffic first circle.
