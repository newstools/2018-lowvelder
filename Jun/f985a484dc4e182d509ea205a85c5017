 BARBERTON – Anton Naudé, one of the organisers, identified the 21-year-old as Kelvin van Baalen. According to Naudé, Van Baalen had struck power lines about eight kilometres south-west of Barberton when a draft pushed him down into the valley. It caused sparks which set the grass underneath him alight and his clothes caught fire. Russel Meiring, communications office for ER24, said that ER24 paramedics arrived on the scene shortly before 13:00. A doctor had already started assessing the man. Paramedics found that he had sustained serious burn wounds. ALSO SEE: Rangers kill alleged rhino poacher They treated him with advanced life support interventions.
