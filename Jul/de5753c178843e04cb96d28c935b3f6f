 SCHOEMANSKLOOF – An eyewitness at the scene stated that the taxi was travelling in the direction towards Mbombela when the driver allegedly pumped the brakes and discovered they had failed. “There was a truck in front of him, so to try to avoid ramming into the back of the truck, he swerved into the oncoming traffic and collided head-on with a white Honda.”  Emer-G-Med operation manager Martin Jeffrey said there were two people in the Honda and the rest were in the taxi. “There were 14 people in the taxi. Luckily, they were all adults.” He said the patients were treated for mild to moderate injuries.  “Various emergency medical services responded to the scene and the patients were taken to Rob Ferreira Hospital and Nelspruit Mediclinic.” Jeffrey concluded that the scene was still being cleared and a stop-and-go implemented.
