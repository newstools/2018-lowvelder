 MBOMBELA – The husband who is alleged to be the victim of a conspiracy to kill him, has issued protection orders against his wife and her co-accused. Lowvelder obtained a copy of the protection order by Pieter Burger against his estranged wife, Elsie, also known as Elske and her co-accused Robert Henry Jacobs.  The pair appeared in the Nelspruit District Court on Monday after their arrest on charges of conspiracy to commit murder. They were both granted bail of R1 500 each on condition that they reported to the investigating officer if they wanted to leave the province. Another condition would be that they do not attempt to contact or intimidate any witnesses. Pieter’s father is a retired SAPS general. The protection he obtained stated that after Pieter and his father had both been threatened with retaliatory action if they did not withdraw the charges against the accused – all via SMS from an unknown number – the Hawks had advised them to lay further charges of intimidation and harassment against the aforesaid parties. The report then states he did in fact then lay the relevant charges under case 67/3/18. The statement also requests that the White River police seize all the firearms in Elsie and Jacobs’ possession. The order requests all state-issued weapons in Jacobs’ possession also be seized, as he is a member of the Mpumalanga Tourism and Parks Agency. On the report issued to him, it is noted that he refused to sign the document and referred the police to his attorney. Defence attorney Coert Jordaan who is defending Jacobs, and Jan du Toit who is representing Elsie, declined to comment regarding the orders.
