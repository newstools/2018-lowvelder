 MBOMBELA – The man who cannot be identified to protect the victim’s identity, appeared in the Nelspruit District Court on Tuesday. Prosecutor Oupa Ndlovu stated that the state opposed bail despite the investigating officer Sgt Cynthia Mpika testifiying that she was not opposed to him being granted bail. She said he had cooperated with the police in their investigation and was not a flight risk. The child had also been placed in the care of her grandmother; about 30 kilometers away from where the accused stayed, Mpika said. The man was arrested last week after a neighbour of the child in Msholozi reported the matter to the police in Masoyi. This after the child told the neighbour that her stepfather was abusing her. “The father was penetrating her private parts with his fingers.” Mpika first could not answer Ndlovu regarding what the docket had stated concerning what transpired before the rape. After the matter stood down, Mpika continued to read out that the father had exposed the child to pornography and asked her to do what was in the picture. “She refused, but he persisted. He continued to show her pornography and was continuing to groom her sexually.” She added that the man abused her when he tucked her and her younger brother into bed at night. In one instance he attempted to penetrate her with his private parts. “She screamed out, as it was painful, and he left her in case the mother heard.” The victim was taken to hospital by Masoyi police and a J88 was filled out. Ndlovu urged the court not to grant bail due to the strong evidence and the age of the victim.
