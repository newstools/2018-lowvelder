 MBOMBELA – The moms of children with special needs, disabilities or chronic illnesses were given time off from their motherly duties and spoiled on Thursday evening.  This event was the brainchild of Hilary Marx. “I am also the mother of a special needs boy. I know the journey and how difficult it can be. I wanted to create an environment where they can relax and do not have to worry about their children for the evening.”  Together with Ananje de Bruin, Cindy Pienaar and volunteers, they arranged the free Supermoms event at Church Unlimited.
