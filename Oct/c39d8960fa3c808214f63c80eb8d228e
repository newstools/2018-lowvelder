MBOMBELA – Curro Nelspruit’s annual valedictory service was held last week in a traditionally formal event at the school. Grade 12 learners were awarded for their hard work and commitment towards academics on what was their final day of high school.
The head leaders of the school delivered an impressive and heartwarming address, wherein they acknowledged the hard work and efforts made by the staff in making their time at Curro successful.
Glory Ngwenya and Dihan Putter also used the opportunity to highlight some of their most special moments with the class of 2018, and Glory very aptly ended her speech by quoting Shakespeare: “Some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon them.”
The headmaster’s address by the executive head of the school, Mike Bownes, was filled with good wishes, backed by his very strong sense of belief in Curro’s educational system and faith, promising greatness and success to accompany every learner throughout the upcoming exams and young adulthood.
The school wished the class of 2018 well in all their future endeavors and final examinations. The top 10 achievers were:
Glory Ngwenya, Catherine Millar, Janelle du Toit, Heinrich Gruber, Sana Jina, Cassandra van den Heever, Lize Nel, Ludwig Gruber, Chloe Brickhill and Hugo Morgan. Special awards:
The Curro Headmaster’s Award and The Rest Character Award – an award donated by the Rest Nature Estate to a pupil who demonstrated commitment in academics, sports and culture throughout their high school career – was received by Dihan Putter for his outstanding achievement in all spheres.
