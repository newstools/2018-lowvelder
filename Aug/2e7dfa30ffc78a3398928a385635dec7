 WHITE RIVER- The name of a specific traffic officer was mentioned by one complainant and a photo of an incident was posted on Facebook.
The complainant (a foreign visitor) alleged that they were stopped by said officer near White River without giving a valid reason. The officer insinuated that the motorist “knows what he did wrong.” He could not provide a speed reading, but suggested that “the fine is R2 000 but the contravention could be forgiven”.

He also alleged that, while they were arguing with the officer, another car was stopped by a colleague and they witnessed how that motorist handed over “something folded in paper” to the cops.
