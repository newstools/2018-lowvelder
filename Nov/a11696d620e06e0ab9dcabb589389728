Every golfer dreams about getting the chance to tee it up with a professional golfer and experience first hand what it takes to be successful as a Tour pro. From the booming drives and precise approaches, to the explosive bunker shots and clutch par saving putts, these guys are on another level! For most of us, the above remains out of our grasp, but for 2 lucky Vodacom Red clients, this dream is about to become a reality.  Not only will 2 Vodacom Red clients find themselves playing with a professional, but they will be playing with a pro at South Africa’s most exclusive golf course, Leopard Creek, in the Alfred Dunhill Championship Pro-am taking place on Tuesday 11 December. Each winner’s prize includes all travel, 2 nights accommodation, food and beverage and invitations to attend Monday’s official Alfred Dunhill Championship Welcome Dinner and Tuesday night’s Alfred Dunhill Championship Pro-am Dinner.  Please note that for Vodacom Red golfers to be considered for this competition, an official handicap of 15 or better is required.
