 MBOMBELA –  According to Bossies Community Justice’s Albert Gryvenstein, the man was hijacked last Friday by two men who pointed firearms at him. “They fled with his blue Volkswagen Polo. I had tracked the vehicles movements for three days, when I got a tip off last night that said the vehicle and the men had been spotted near Tekwane North.” Gryvenstein called Vlam Els and a staff member from Lowveld Vehicle Tracking Solutions who arrived to help him.  “I stopped on a road in Tekwane North to wait for Vlam. Just as he arrived, we turned to see the suspects and the stolen vehicle driving towards us.” The men immediately stopped the vehicle and arrested the two suspects. “We found two firearms in the Volkswagen Polo. They had resprayed the vehicle white.” Gryvenstein said vehicle theft and hijackings were once again on the rise in the area. “People must make sure they have decent tracking systems fitted into their vehicles. “
He concluded that this was not just for the recovery of the vehicle, but also for the driver and passengers. “A lot of people say they do not want their vehicle back if someone takes it. Well if someone takes you along with your vehicle, then it is a matter of life and death that you have a tracking device, “he said.
