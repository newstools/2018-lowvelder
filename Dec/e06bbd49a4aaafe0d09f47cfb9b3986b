 BARBERTON – Over 100 workers employed at Verulam Sawmills will have a bleak Christmas after they were dismissed by the company. According to Wonderboy Mabelane, shop steward for Chemical Energy Paper Printing Wood and Allied Workers Union (CEPPWAWU), which represents the majority of the workers, they have been at loggerheads with the employer, Edward Ferreirinha, since November 26. Ferreirinha is a director for Verulam. Mabelane said all they wanted from the company was the employer to pay them their 21 days annual leave on full pay. He said currently, the employer was offering them 15 days annual leave, which is also unpaid for.

According to the Basic Conditions of Employment Acts, a worker is entitled to 21 consecutive days of paid annual leave. However, our employer does not provide us with the 21 days, instead each employee is provided with 15 days, which is unpaid,” said Mabelane. He said following days of the workers engaging in a go slow, they were surprised when the employers served them with dismissal letters last Wednesday. “The employer has failed to engage with us in a discussion around a table. The only thing he managed to engage with us was through the dismissal letters,” said Mabelane. He said they have since taken the matter with the CCMA to appeal their dismissal. When contacted, Ferrerinha said he was not interested to comment on the matter, hanging up thereafter. Several attempts to get hold of him after that proved unfruitful as his phone went directly to the voicemail.
