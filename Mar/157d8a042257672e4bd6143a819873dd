 MBOMBELA – Robberts spoke about the processes of how to create beauty, how to use different techniques when applying make-up and how to create a flawless appearance and enhance one’s physical features. The event was organised by the local branch of the South African Council for Business Women (SACBW), whose mandate is to unlock potential, help women grow to their full potential in reaching their goals and to be successful in business.  According to Odette Hartzenberg of the SACBW, with this year’s upcoming meetings they will focus on supporting members, networking and building a relationship between all businesswomen in Mbombela. “The best thing about being part of the SACBW is that we support one another, although competition is healthy. From my own experience, we as businesswomen in similar industries motivate and support one another. We mentor our youth and network for new possibilities in business,” she said.
