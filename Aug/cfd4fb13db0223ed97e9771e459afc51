As an adjective, the word special is defined as, otherwise different from what is usual. At St Peter’s School Mbombela we do not see things as they are, we see things as we are. A learning environment which is as caring and enriching as are the relationships between the Parents, students and staff. From the indoor to the outdoor classroom expressing creativity and individuality, just like a piece in a puzzle we have a unique position to occupy. Watching the children’s inquisitive nature, compassion and social awareness blossom. Whether it be in choir, marimba Friendship Friday or afternoon clubs, it is a constant reminder to us of why we love what we do. Inclusion to us is not simply about being enrolled, it is about planning for the success of every single student.
