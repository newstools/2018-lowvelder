A reward of R1 500 in cash is still up for grabs, and a mystery prize could be yours if you unravel this secret.
A new piece of art appeared at PPE Technologies on Wednesday, in plain sight on the wall adjacent to the slipway to the old showgrounds on the R40. Clue: Look closer, a number appeared on each painting and could possibly be another clue and refer to the previous works of art.
