 Here are the top five practically impossible to spot for your list: The Aardvark This very unique looking animal  is  nearly impossible to see in the wild: The name  comes from the Afrikaans language and means ‘earth pig’ or ‘ground pig’. The reason that they are so hard to spot is because aadvarks are nocturnal.  Pangolin Pangolins are one of the most threatened animals in the world, and they are so rare that many tour guides will retire without ever having seen one. So if you spot one, be sure to tick it off your bucket list.  Aardwolf The name means “earth wolf” in Afrikaans or civet hyena, based on its habit of secreting substances from its anal gland, a characteristic shared with the civet. The aardwolf is in the same family as the hyena.   Riverine Rabbit Riverine rabbits are on the critically endangered list .  They are very habitat-specific and are found in dense patches of riverine bush along seasonal rivers   Pels fishing owl A recent survey in the far north of the Kruger National Park for the elusive Pel’s fishing owl, has had disappointing results. Only four birds were found during a three-day survey. So if you are able to put this bird on your list, consider yourself blessed.
