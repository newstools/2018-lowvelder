Mopani Pharmacy is an independent pharmacy with four stores serving the Lowveld. They are taking care of our community through their professional service and innovative pharmaceutical solutions. Mopani Pharmacy’s pharmacists have the advantage of cutting-edge technology supporting them. A German-engineered automated dispensary system packs, stores and accurately picks the medication keyed in by their dispensers at Crossing Centre and I’langa Mall.  Apart from a quick and efficient experience at their dispensaries, patients can also rely on Mopani to make taking complex and multiple prescriptions easier with their convenient EasyPlan blister pack service. It is imperative that medications are taken exactly as prescribed to ensure the desired outcome for the patient. However, when you or a loved one are prescribed multiple medications and given multiple directions on taking those medications, it can become very difficult to remember everything. This is where Mopani’s EasyPlan Blister Pack can help.  Divided into 4 packs per month, each blister pack is hygienically separated into days of the week, and time of the day. They are carefully filled with your unique combination of medication so you can simply pop-out the medications as indicated on the pack.  You can have your EasyPlan blister pack delivered or prepared for collection, and you will receive a choice of either sms, telephone call or email notification. Taking medication as prescribed is now easier and more accurate than ever before. Contact Courien on 013 755 5594 or via email at easyplan@mopani.co.za for more information.
