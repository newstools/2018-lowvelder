 MBOMBELA – The voting in the Lowveld’s most prestigious consumer awards opens on July 20 and closes on August 17. Past winners agree that Lowvelder’s Best of Mbombela Readers’ Choice Awards is an excellent marketing opportunity. The newspaper will have information sessions about the benefits of participating in this year’s awards on Thursday. There is no nomination process – the public can vote for absolutely any establishment, big or small, new or institutionalised, located in either Mbombela or White River. Simply determine in which category their superior services belong, and enter the company’s name to vote and reward your favourite. Lowvelders are loyal supporters of local businesses and have proven in past editions of the awards that they are willing to vote for their favourites to earn the best service providers the coveted title of Best in Mbombela. All you have to do is vote, and encourage your customers to vote for you, by visiting bestofmbombela.co.za. This year you still choose your favourite places to eat, drink, be entertained and shop for all manner of goods and services, with a few added subcategories (see below).
