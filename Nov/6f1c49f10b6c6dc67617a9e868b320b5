Voltex Nelspruit has been part of the Lowveld for the past 20 years.  As an annual way to show their appreciation for both clients and suppliers, they hosted a thank you function at the new open facility at Mbombela Stadium last week.  “We host this exhibition each year to thank all our valued customers for their support throughout the year,” said Santie Basson, the event coordinator, who had a vibrant team which assisted with the setting up before the function, and breaking down afterwards.  “Without this exceptional team and management the exhibition would not have been possible,” said Basson, and added that this was the biggest exhibition yet, with 53 suppliers and a whopping 372 customers who attended.  “It gave our suppliers a lot of exposure and our customers enjoyed the evening with supper and drinks on us,” she said.  “We would like to thank Chris and Carmen Naude from Marlins Pub and Grill for supper and the bar, and Plant Pride for the plants. Our MC, Dave Walters, thank you for have been a part of our show for the last five years,” she said. She extended her thanks to Dougs Hiring, AVS, Mr Helium, Loo 4 U, Divergent Ops and Sonja Visser from Catch the Moment photography.
