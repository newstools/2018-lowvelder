 “It’s not just about the motorcycles. It’s a whole lifestyle.” Those are the words of Shaun Brown, dealer principal at Harley-Davidson Big Five. He explained that the events, like the one last Saturday, are not just about selling motorcycles, but about sharing in the passion of driving one.  “Days like these are about everyone having fun and we aim to do it more often now,” Brown said. The day also included a preview for the BosRock festival that was held on October 5. “Good old rock and roll and bikes are the perfect combination,” Brown said. He added that they had their own stall at the festival as well. Suzaan Duthie from Go Nelspruit, who assisted in the marketing of the event, said that they aim to create a social networking experience for people.  “We like to bring people together who have a lot in common, but are also diverse. I think that is what we did here again today and also what we will aim to do in the future,” Duthie said.
