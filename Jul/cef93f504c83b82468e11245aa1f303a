 MBOMBELA – In the past couple of days, the Lowveld has been experiencing a series of abnormally cold winter days. Some even say it must be the coldest it’s ever been. According to Accuweather, these were the temperatures measured in Mpumalanga’s capital city during the first two weeks of this month (July 2018).   According to these measurement, the average minimum temperature was around 9°C. The mercury, however, dropped significantly this past week, to an average of around 6°C:   Has it really “never been this cold”? Absolutely not, said the South African Weather Services’ Elsa de Jager. Although temperatures are a little lower than usual, below are the actual lowest temperatures ever recorded in the Lowveld: Komatidraai, the closest data available to Komatipoort’s lowest ever temperature was -0,3 °C on July 24, 2014. The lowest temperature available for White River was -1,7 °C on June 17, 2010, at Kruger Mpumalanga International Airport. The coldest Mbombela has ever been was on June 28, 1964 when the mercury dropped to -2°C. The year 2002 saw the coldest temperature recorded in Badplaas – also -2°C. Barberton recorded -2,7°C on August 3, 1972.
