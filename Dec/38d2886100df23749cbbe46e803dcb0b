The Amakhosi, as Chiefs are known in football circles, stated on their website on Tuesday that the decision to host the Premiership game on at Mbombela was due to the condition of the pitch at FNB Stadium, where the match was originally scheduled to take place. Chiefs said the pitch condition was due to three major events that have taken place at the 2010 Fifa World Cup final venue. The latest of those came on Sunday, where the Global Citizen concert saw the stadium packed to capacity as the likes of Beyoncé, Jay-Z, Ed Sheeran and Cassper Nyovest performed. Before that, Guns N’ Roses performed and a prayer event was held there during November.
