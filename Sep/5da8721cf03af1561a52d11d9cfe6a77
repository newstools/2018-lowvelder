 According to TRAC N4 R36 between Machadodorp and Carolina has been closed due to protests. The protests started earlier today when a local shop was looted and set alight. This came after a man was assaulted by two other men who are allegedly members of the local community policing forum (CPF). However, MEC for  the Department of Safety, Security and Liaison, Pat Ngomane said that they do not belong to any CPF structure or a security company. According to bystanders on the scene earlier today the incident was racially motivated. The community felt betrayed when the two accused appeared in court in Belfast instead of being kept at Machdodorp and they threatened to plunder the city if these two men are not brought to justice.

She does not look at colour, creed, race or anything. We are here as law enforcement to ensure that the people are safe and secure,” Bhembe said and added that people are free to protest but if they find themselves on the wrong side of the law, they will be reprimanded. “We would like to plead for sanity to prevail on them as well,” Bhembe said and asked that the community member do not prevent law enforcement from doing their jobs.
