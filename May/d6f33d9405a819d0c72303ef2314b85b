 MBOMBELA – The Nelspruit SPCA shared a statement and photos on their Facebook page alleging that the owners reported that their boerboel was shot in the face. The animal was put down. Marcelle Hoffman from SPCA said that they received a call from their head office in Alberton, Gauteng concerning the incident.  “The owner stays in Mataffin and on our arrival we found the dog in a very bad condition. Her skull and spine was clearly visible in the gaping wound. Her face appeared to be mushy and her eyes were not open completely. She had received no medication and was in excruciating pain. The wound on her neck was deep and filled with fluid. Various deep cuts and lacerations were also over her nasal area. After she died we could clearly feel the breaks in her facial area,” she explained.  Hoffman said the dog was euthanized to prevent any further suffering. She urged the public to report any cruelty to Nelspruit SPCA.
