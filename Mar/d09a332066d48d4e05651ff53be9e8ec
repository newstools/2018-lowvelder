 WHITE RIVER – The seventh annual Gospel Skouspel took place at Manna Church on the R40 this past Friday night, and was, as always, a huge success. The guests poured in – despite the torrents of rain – umbrellas up and ready while the children splashed and played in the puddles. The mood was festive and the anticipation mounted as the minutes ticked by, the audience expecting a wonderful evening of Lowveld talent to rival the best. And of course, they were not disappointed.

The Skouspel is the brainchild of Marinda Toerien, who decided on a concert to raise funds for Children in Distress (CID), and to date, in the seven years since its inception, the event has managed to raise enough money to provide 16 000 meals for CID. This year saw about 20 performers entertain the audience. Local artists included magician Andre Bladwell, Ilse and Wynand Mare from the group Havanna, as well as singers Marishia Pienaar and Rolene Schoonraad. The musicians involved all have day jobs, but give of their free time and God-given talent to participate in this prestigious event, which has grown so much in the past seven years that there is now a waiting list to perform.

This elegant and esteemed affair never disappoints, and every member of the audience, from young to old, are thoroughly entertained by the phenomenal talent that resides on our very doorstep. Indeed, after seven years of being a success story, it is obvious that the Mbombela Gospel Skouspel is going to continue going from strength to strength.
