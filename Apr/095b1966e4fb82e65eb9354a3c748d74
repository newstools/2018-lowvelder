 SKUKUZA – Lower Sabie Camp in the Kruger National Park (KNP) now completely runs off grid during daylight. This first of four pilot solar photo-voltaic energy plants that in future will supply all electricity needed by the camp, was erected at a cost of R13 million and went live in October last year. The three others are being built at Skukuza, Tsokwane and Nkuhlu. According to KNP senior manager of electromechanical services, Linda Mhlongo, this is part of the park’s efforts to use more natural resources and go even greener in terms of total nature conservation. Currently the camp relies on Eskom power during the evenings, since a back-up battery system has not yet been acquired and set up. Once that is in place, the plant will supply all 343 kilowatts needed. While only half of the plant’s capacity is currently used with the rest lost, installing such a battery system is a priority. Mhlongo said even without the battery system, they save 40 per cent of their Eskom costs. “By this, we already contribute to saving resources and contributing to a greener environment.” The plant consists of 2 088 panels and can produce 343 kilowatts when in operation. “We are also lucky to have sunshine ninety per cent of the time in the park,” Mhlongo said. Solar photo-voltaic energy plants are very capital-intensive – the one at Skukuza costs R16 million, but the four plants were sponsored by the national Department of Tourism. It paid for the panels as part of a drive to enhance the tourism industry. With the savings incurred, the park expects a full return on that investment within seven to eight years. The plants are protected from animals and intruders by very strong fences with strategically placed cameras. The solar-panel structures will also serve as shaded parking at the Nkuhlu and Tsokwane picnic spots. SANParks will also negotiate with Eskom to eventually sell excess electricity back to them.
