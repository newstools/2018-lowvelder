 MBOMBELA – On Monday before the rise of the fuel price at midnight on Tuesday, local fuel stations were already charging R16,03 for a litre. After investigations it was found that this, however, is not an irregularity. “The further you are from the coast, the more expensive the fuel is, due to the cost to transport it,” said Kuzi Maya from Puma Energy. According to the website of the Department of Energy, this cost was last adjusted on April 2, 2014. Maya explained that the opposite was also true. “The closer you live to the coast, the cheaper the fuel is because there are fewer transport costs involved.” READ ALSO: Fuel increase: Why Lowvelders pay more than the rest of SA Fanie de Haas, owner of Gateway Motors filling station at Halls, said after the increase, a litre of petrol will now cost locals R16,26. This is now 46 cents more than the coastal price of R15,80 post-increase. “We are definitely feeling the increase,” De Haas said, adding that people do not fill their vehicles to the brim anymore. According to the Automobile Association, the fuel price comprises four main elements: the general fuel levy, the Road Accident Fund levy, the basic fuel price (freight and insurance costs, cargo dues, storage and financing) and wholesale and retail margins, distribution and transport costs.
