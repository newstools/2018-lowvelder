 MBOMBELA – Women always return home from the SACBW’s monthly meetings. It may sound like a no-brainer, but at least one will most definitely not be coming home from the council’s next planned evening meeting. At their suitcase party on April 26, the lucky winner will be staying over in a hotel after the event, to fly away to an undisclosed destination the following day. She can bring her partner, and they will need their passports to get where they are going. Council president, Anneke Pienaar is tight-lipped about the destination. The most Lowvelder could determine is that the trip will last for three days – and that it would be impractical to need pre-approved visas. Simply buy a raffle ticket, pack your suitcase, bring your partner and your valid passport and you are A for away.

Its monthly meetings, however, are best described as fun gatherings of friends. The SACBW always looking for new members and any working woman is invited to join. In a twist, and for one night only, attendees may also bring their partners next week so they can fly off together. The suitcase party takes place from 18:00 at Nelspruit Airfield. The cost is R190 per person, which includes dinner and a drink voucher. A cash bar will be available. To enter the raffle costs R50 per ticket. Remember that if your passport is not travel-ready, you will forfeit the prize. To RSVP and for more information, email nelspruit.admin@sacbw.org by April 23.
