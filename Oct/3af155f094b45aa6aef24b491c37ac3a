 As part of TRAC’s support towards the inaugural BosRock music festival being held at Kwanyoni Lodge, situated on the N4 Toll Route, this Saturday, the Lowveld’s most iconic rock – Old Joe, was painted as the legendary South African rocker Piet Botha. WATCH: Lowveld, get ready to BosRock  “The festival has been engineered to attract thousands of old-school rock enthusiasts from all over South Africa to Mbombela, and in turn bring an economic injection to the region which falls in line with one of TRACs core CSI responsibilities – socio economic development,” said TRAC Spokesman, Solange Soares Nicholson. Botha is one of the core members of The RIDERS, which will headline the main concert. Old Joe’s new costume is courtesy of renowned Lowveld artist – Ghost.
