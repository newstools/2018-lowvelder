 MBOMBELA – The top-achieving pupils and schools in the city were recognised by the provincial Department of Education for their hard work and dedication.
Almost 30 schools were represented at the Mbombela Circuit Awards at Hoërskool Nelspruit last week, where sterling work and determination were acknowledged. Before the circuit manager Musa Linkwati addressed the audience, Banele Mthenjane of Hoërskool Nelspruit, opened the preceding with a chilling rendition of the national anthem. It sounded as sweet as the new dawn that might await South Africa, with the newly elected president Cyril Ramaphosa.  The latter accepted his nomination just a day before the awards. Bishop VP Ndaka, who also addressed the crowd, placed emphasis on the fact that this new season will bring change, not only within the country, but to education too. He said the latter is the foundation for all we do in life, that it shapes who we are and what we aspire to be.
Linkwati emphasised the importance of education and said the aim of the awards is to enforce and encourage excellence at a young age. He applauded schools that achieved a pass rate of 80 per cent or higher in 2017. Hoërskool Nelspruit was named the overall top-performing school in the district and province, and received a prize for its 100 per cent matric score. It was closely followed by Bergvlam, which achieved a 99,98 per cent pass rate. Here are all the results: Awards 2018 Secondary list Awards 2018 Primary list Awards 2018 Combined schools list
