The all-new Peugeot 3008’s model range just grew a little bigger with the addition of the 2.0 HDi Diesel Engine models that arrived in South Africa this month. For the first time since its launch in 2017, the 3008 now has a choice of a diesel engine, and also has a 20g lower CO2 fuel emission than the 1.6 derivative which makes it evident why this vehicle’s engine won engine of the year for 2016 and 2017.  The 2.0 HDi will be available in two models, namely the 2.0 HDi Active, which comes with a manual gearbox, and a 2.0HDi Allure, that is available with an automatic gearbox. The Active model can be yours for R449 900, or you can own the Allure for R499 900. Why you should be test-driving the all-new Peugeot 3008 SUV today!
