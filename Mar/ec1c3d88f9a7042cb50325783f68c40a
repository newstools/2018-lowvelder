Nobody was injured during the blaze. Mbombela municipality spokesman Joseph Ngala stated that the police and the fire department were looking into the matter. “We have questions why the building’s fire alarm and sprinklers did not go off. “The reason for them malfunctioning is a huge question we need answered.” Crown National spokesman Dawid Muller said, “Unfortunately I cannot respond at this stage, as the matter is under investigation. “Any comment at this stage will be purely speculative and information is sub judice.” The business is currently being run from 31 Waterfall Avenue, Riverside Industrial Park.
