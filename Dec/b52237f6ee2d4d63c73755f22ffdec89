 We all have that one uncle or two that is always problematic in the family or better yet who is a black sheep who is always asking money for beer or cigarettes. Well, we all know the black tax system and how it works. We’ve got good news for you! There is a way to avoid being taxed by uncle Tom. Duck the bullet Ahead of time, spend a few minutes thinking about how you want to behave. Don’t act like you’ve got all the money in the world, that will be detrimental. Rather plead poverty and try to steer attention to something else for him to forget what he initially was asking for, it works! Avoid chilling with him as much as possible. If you want to have a few drinks and want to save while you at it, don’t chill with your uncle! Rather be with your cousins because there will be understanding, especially if they are your peers. You will be able to avoid a lot of problems, stay in your lane. Don’t run errands with him! It will be Christmas and New Year’s Day and it gets busy at home since there will be luncheon and there are few things you might to get. Your uncle might want to trick you into telling you that he wants to assist you at the mall with carrying things. Play hide and seek until you escape! Otherwise, you might find yourself I a very difficult situation at the mall by overspending. Keep it brief! If he asks you how much you bought your Guess T-shirt just tell him you got it as a gift or at an event, that way you avoid getting into the money conversation, very dangerous. He might ask you to buy him one as well and he won’t be joking. Sympathise with him if needs be When you steer the “brief” conversation with him simply sympathise with him because he is going to tell about all his problems, including financial problems. Give him the right advice but don’t give him the impression that you will rescue him and be comforting him Stuyvesant cigarettes, be careful. Enjoy and have a fabulous Festive Season!
