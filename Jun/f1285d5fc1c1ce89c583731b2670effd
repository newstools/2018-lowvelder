 The annual Father’s Day Classic Car event was held at Casterbridge for the first time this year, and, said one of the organisers Louie Amorin, “It was a short-notice affair which did not allow us enough time to get all and everyone involved. And who will forget these? You can’t. They were well-suited for performance pimping and the rest. It was a good learning experience though, and 2019 will present a much-improved and more vibrant event.” I am thinking, perhaps the owners or exhibitors should also dress period style – a fashion show, a best-dressed competition, a concourse d’elegance; but wait, I am getting way ahead of myself.

But when it cleared, visitors piled in in their droves. So much so that the restaurants had to close their doors by twelve, because they were fully seated. The results of this means that the 2019 event will also include more food stalls.

Although the venue and grass surface presented many challenges, this venue brought a different energy to this event. It was more relaxed and countryside-like, which I think fits the classic theme perfectly.
