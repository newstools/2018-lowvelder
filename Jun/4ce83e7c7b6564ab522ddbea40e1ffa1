 MBOMBELA – Eskom announced on Tuesday that there is a low probability of load shedding during the day, but that it will become more likely during the evening peak period between 17:00 and 21:00 due to a normal expected increase in demand. Should load shedding be implemented, it would be for a period up to four hours, the power utility said in a statement.
