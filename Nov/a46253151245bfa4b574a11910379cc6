 #HearMeToo: End Violence against Women and Children is the theme for this year’s 16 Days of Activism. The campaign was launched on Sunday.  The MEC of community safety, security and liaison, Pat Ngomane lead the opening of the provincial ceremony in Zwelisha. Every year during the campaign a number of activities are conducted in order to highlight awareness around the abuse of women, children and people living with disabilities. 16 Days of Activism will end on December 10, a day also known as International Human Rights Day.

• Expand accountability beyond the Justice, Crime Prevention and Security cluster to include all government clusters and provinces.
• Combine technology, social media, the arts, journalism, religion, culture and customs, business and activism to draw attention to the many ways violence against women and children affects the lives of all people in all communities around the world.
• Ensure mass mobilisation of all communities to promote collective responsibility in the fight to eradicate violence against women and children.
• Encourage society to acknowledge that violence against women and children is not a government or criminal justice system problem, but a societal problem, and that failure to view it as such results in all efforts failing to eradicate this scourge in our communities.
• Emphasise the fact that the solution lies with all of us.
