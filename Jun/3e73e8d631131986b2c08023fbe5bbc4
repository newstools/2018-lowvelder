 In 2017, World Wide Worx estimated that Twitter had around 8 million users in South Africa, a 4% increase compared to the year before. Collins said he could not confirm or refute the figure, as Twitter does not break down individual country markets. He also said that it isn’t focussing on monthly users, but daily active users.

Twitter does not report daily active user numbers, but does report the growth, which has been 10% or greater since the fourth quarter of 2016.

Additionally, the company has built tools like Twitter Lite for more bandwidth-strapped regions, like South Africa and its neighbours, which has enabled people to use the platform more regularly. “In general, we aim to build one Twitter and give people tools to create and produce their own content,” said Collins. He said that video is where much of their focus and growth is currently. “Over half our ad revenue comes from video, and we continue to see the most innovation around video.” Original content: My Broadband Follow Lowvelder on Twitter: @Lowvelder
