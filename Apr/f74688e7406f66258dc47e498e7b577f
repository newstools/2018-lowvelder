 MPUMALANGA – Six pedestrians have been killed in three separate incidents in Mpumalanga since the beginning of the long weekend.   Mpumalanga Community Safety, Security and Liaison MEC Pat Ngomane appealed to motorists to use the road with great caution to avoid any further loss of lives. The department’s spokesman Joseph Mabuza said two people were hit by two sedans simultaneously on the R40 between Barberton and Mbombela around 18:00 on Saturday while two more people also lost their lives when they were hit on the R40 Road in Bushbuckridge last night.

Both the incidents occurred on the N4.” He said although it was not clear what caused these accidents, it was suspected that some of the pedestrians may have consumed alcohol and jaywalked on the road. The police are still investigating causes of these crashes Ngomane stated that pedestrians should be visible at night so that motorists are able to see them from a distance. He encouraged pedestrians who consume alcohol to avoid busy roads and highways as this endangers their lives needlessly. He also urged motorists to be on the lookout for pedestrians especially at night and near busy areas and to avoid driving at excessively high speed especially in areas where visibility is restricted as they may likely cause avoidable crashes.

Members of the public must also report any bad driving to authorities so that wrong doers are brought to book,” he said.
