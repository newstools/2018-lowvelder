 MBOMBELA – Four Ehlanzeni traffic officers were honoured for their outstanding work during the festive season. MEC for community safety, security and liaison, Pat Ngomane awarded Nkateko Sihlangu, Vincent Ngomane, Victor Sifundza and Senzosenkosi Mbuyane R2 000 vouchers each at Mbombela Stadium on Tuesday.  “This does not mean that the rest of you did not work hard, but this should encourage you to aim to always stand out,” said Ngomane. “For the province, we felt that it would be a huge mistake to begin the year without appreciating the hard work and effort shown by the traffic officers during the festive season.”  Mbali Mhlongo (17) and Nothando Manana (17) were also awarded laptops, which Ngomane bought himself, for representing the province at a road-safety competition in Rustenburg in North-West in October last year. Mbali, a grade- 12 learner from Kiriyatswane Secondary School in Embalenhle in Secunda was the national winner in the debate category. Nothando, a grade- 12 pupil at Lugbhuta High School in Schoemansdal was the winner in the speech category with her presentation on “Non-motorised transportation being the best solution”. “These guys are going to go far,” Ngomane said .  The meeting was held in conjunction with transport minister, Joe Maswanganyi’s 2017/18 festive-season report. The province recorded a 7,6 per cent decline in road fatalities compared to the previous year. A total of 181 people died during this festive period compared to 196 in 2016. There were 891 road crashes compared to the previous year’s 812. “The increase in the number of pedestrians dying on the roads is also alarming,” said Ngomane.  He said there needed to be a continued focus on more awareness campaigns and education on pedestrians. Ngomane urged traffic officers not to fall victim bribes and urged them to report their colleagues.
