 The drop in water levels in the Lowveld continue with the temperatures increasing with the arrival of the new season.  The mercury is expected to rise to 36 degrees Celsius in the province’s capital today, and it’s expected to peak at 40 tomorrow.  According to the Department of Water and Sanitation’s weekly state of reservoirs report of September 17, the average dam levels recorded an average drop in water volumes from 81,6 per cent to 79,78 in the Ehlanzeni Region, in the last two weeks.  It is more than ever critical that we all work together and use the available water in a more efficient and conservative manner so as to ensure that our water resources are not depleted as water has no substitute. Let us stop all the leaks and ensure that no drop of this special resource is lost in an irresponsible manner.
