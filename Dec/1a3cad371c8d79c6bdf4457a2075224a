 People illegally dumping in the Gladdespruit are becoming increasingly brazen. A community member recently found two men dumping refuse into the river, and when he confronted them they showed him rude signs. Reon van Aardt, a community member who also witnessed the incident, said this is not the first time and in the very same location. “We are unhappy about it, and the area has a sign stating that dumping is not allowed on the location. I feel that illegal dumping is environmentally unfriendly and poses an unnecessary health and safety risk for residents. I want to encourage the public to dump in designated places. I hope that the municipality will act and impose a fine on reported illegal dumpers,” said Van Aardt.

In the post, Manda Gomes was concerned about this occurrence, and wanted to know what could be done about it. City of Mbombela Local Municipality (CMLM) spokesman, Joseph Ngala said dumping rubbish in a river is a criminal offence. “If the community members find anyone dumping things in the river, they should report the matter to the municipality or SAPS immediately. If you have photos of the incident you can also submit them. This will also help with the case. Dumping things in the river causes pollution and it is an environmental hazard,” he said. Ngala said CMLM has done various things to educate the community about illegal dumping in and around Mbombela. “We have done articles in the media and also raised awareness about it. “There’s a law that prohibits such action and the community must avoid dumping refuse,” he added.
Ngala said the municipality will continue to make people aware about the dangers of illegal dumping.
