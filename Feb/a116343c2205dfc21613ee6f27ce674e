You can get involved by joining upcoming seminars on topics such as “Basics to Bitcoin” and “Advanced cryptocurrency trading” or join the team for an informal “Beer & Bitcoin” evening. With like-minded businessmen like Uniwisp’s Desmond Cogill and Marius Botha on board, you can be sure that you will feel like part of the Bitmart crypto community. Uniwisp is Bitmart’s ICT, Data and Connection partner and the pair will be launching a satellite mining connection that will enable mining machines to mine from anywhere in the world thanks to its satellite link. This is next level!  Whilst the whole world is talking about Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, it is important to get involved with a reputable company who can teach you all the ins and outs of the industry. It is recommended that in order to minimise risk, one should own their hardware and not invest with a third party who promises big gains. Potential investors are flooded by claims of quick profits if they invest with specific traders or companies but if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Bitmart makes it easy for anyone to enter the cryptocurrency market. Bitmart offers a plug and play solution when you buy a certified miner from Bitmart. You will receive training, support and after sales service. One can expect an average monthly return of 6 – 15% before associated data and power costs.  The company goes a step further and provides customers with an app that allows you to manage your miner, a dashboard for quick access to exchanges and trading information as well as Bitmart’s very own GPU mining rig software. Don’t break your head about the technology – Bitmart will help you get settled in in no time. Bitmart also offers a Shepherd Service that will protect parties who wish to buy second hand miners. The machine will be tested to ensure it performs optimally and Bitmart’s friendly staff will see to a smooth transaction taking place between buyer and seller. Bitmart can even help businesses put systems in place to accept Bitcoin as payment for services or products. Setting the record straight The fast pacing world of cryptocurrencies is not a get-rich-quick scheme. It requires investors to understand how the industry works so that they can make informed decisions. It is important to speak to professionals about the risks associated with the industry and what is the best way to grow your money. Setting up mining machines requires electricity, internet and a cooling or ventilation system. Bitmart can help you with a proper set-up for your mining machines and a full mining farm deployment solution. Mining cryptocurrencies is a safe and secure way to ensure a passive income of crypto coins. Bitcoin is a world currency and can easily be influenced by world events. Remember to never panic sell or do emotional buying. Bitcoin is not a bubble or ponzi scheme. When comparing Bitcoin’s value to that of other fiat currencies, it becomes clear that Bitcoin is still undervalued. Bitcoin is accessible to everyone who has a laptop, PC, tablet or smart phone as you can easily buy cryptocurrencies and keep it in a wallet app. Due to Bitcoin’s open ledger, it is not a tool for criminals to abuse. If a person linked their wallet address to their FICA details on an exchange, they can be traced.  Thanks to Bitcoin’s secure and advanced blockchain technology, cryptocurrencies are becoming the currency of the future. Bitmart is rubbing shoulders with industry leaders on a daily basis and recently joined cryptocurrency super stars like John McAfee on the second annual Blockchain Cruise that took place in Singapore. Meeting with more than 650 cryptocurrency enthusiasts, retailers, investors and analysts, Bitmart is staying on top of its game.
