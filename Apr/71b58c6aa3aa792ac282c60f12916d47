 MBOMBELA – Piet van Zyl revealed this reckless driver on Facebook on April 12. “The trucks on Long Tom Pass are driving like pigs. They drive over a solid line when turning, almost blocking the road entirely. What if another car comes from the other side? Nowadays it is life-threatening to drive on the pass.” Hugo le Roux, spokesman for Izusa Carriers said he would like to thank the public for bringing cases like this one to their attention.

This allows us to initiate immediate action to prevent any re-occurrences, and enforce our zero-tolerance policy on bad driving. “Since the incident was brought to my attention, steps have been taken against the driver by our human resources department. Internal investigations are under way,” Le Roux said. Jan Venter commented on Van Zyl’s post, stating that it is not only truck drivers that are the culprits. “Regular vehicle drivers are just as guilty as any truck driver.” Lowvelder’s sister publication Steelburger /Lydenburg News has assisted in launching a petition against trucks on the pass.
