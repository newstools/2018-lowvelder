 On a farm just outside town lives an eclectic soul with a free spirit, named Naomi Tagg. She lived in England for six years, got married in the Netherlands and is one of only a handful of South Africans who plays the electric violin. “I love that you can take it absolutely anywhere, plug it in and cut through all the noise,” Tagg said about this unusual instrument. She explained that an acoustic violin is made from wood, while an electric violin can be made from a variety of other materials, such as plastic. While Tagg was studying music at the University of Cape Town from 2000 to 2002 she was looking for the perfect instrument that would portray her personality.

People usually look at a violin as a traditional instrument that can only be used in classical music,” Tagg said. “With this instrument I can show people that you are able to rock out even with a violin.” After she obtained her degree she joined the electric trio The Muses for five years and then started with her solo career. She travelled the world playing with various artists and DJs, educating people on the fact that a violin is so much more than a classical instrument. Tagg also had the privilege to be the opening act for artists like Elton John, John Legend and Michael Bolton.
