 According to the Law and Order Index, which is a composite score based on people’s reported confidence in their local police, their feelings of personal safety and the incidence of theft and assault or mugging in the previous year. This study asked more than 148 000 people across 142 countries in 2017. The higher the score they gave in the interview , the higher the proportion of the population that reported feeling secure in their country. The index score for the world in 2017 was 81 out of a possible 100. Meaning an average of 81 out of 100 people felt safe and secure in their country.  The countries scoring the best and the worst on the index remained unchanged from 2016 with scores worldwide ranging from a high of 97 in Singapore to a low of 44 in Venezuela. Venezuela earned the “least secure” title alone in 2016 and in 2017, it shared the title with war-torn Afghanistan, where a score of 45 hit a record low. South Africa was also one of the lowest ranking countries, behind Mexico and Botswana, with an index score of 58. Just 17% of Venezuelans in 2017 said they feel safe walking alone in their area at night ,only slightly higher than the 12% who said so in 2016.
