 MBOMBELA – The Department of Environmental Affairs’ (DEA) Working on Fire (WoF) programme participants in Mpumalanga joined the global community to commemorate World Wetlands Day (WWD) on Friday.

The WoF team based in Badplaas led a clean-up campaign in a wetland identified at the school, and spent a day with grade six and seven pupils, educating them about the importance and benefits of wetlands.

Lack of community awareness of their value and benefits often leads to their transformation by humans.
“As mandated by the DEA, our teams remain committed to protecting the environment against the dire effects of wild-land fires and by allowing Mother Nature to play her role in the ecosystem,” said WoF provincial spokesman, Lebogang Maseko.
